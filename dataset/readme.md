## dolly_chatgpt_got4_mixed.json
Using the instructions from the original Dolly dataset, responses were regenerated with GPT-3.5 with temperature of 0.5 and GPT-4 with temperature of 0.7. After filtering out 22 data, 14,989 out of a total 15,011 data were utilized. Among the 14,989 data, 13,491 were generated by GPT-3.5 and 1,498 were generated by GPT-4.

## dolly_preference_trainset.json and dolly_preference_testset.json
Responses were generated using GPT-3.5 (with temperature set to 0.5) and compared to the original response using GPT-4 as a judge. Excluding ties, 11,911 instances were finally obtained and split into training and test sets. The output data is composed of [chosen, rejected].

In the training set:

* 8,929 instances had the GPT-3.5 data as the chosen and the original data as the rejected.
* 1,790 instances had the original data as the chosen and the GPT-3.5 data as the rejected.

In the test set:

* 1,000 instances had the GPT-3.5 data as the chosen and the original data as the rejected.
* 192 instances had the original data as the chosen and the GPT-3.5 data as the rejected.
