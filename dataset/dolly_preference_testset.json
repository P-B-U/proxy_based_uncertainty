Friendly competitions and matches organized between clubs are not included. The football associations FIFA and UEFA run international and European competitions; while The Football Association, and its mostly self-governing subsidiary bodies the English Football League and Premier League, run national competitions.\n\nThe European governing body UEFA was founded in 1954, and created their first and most prestigious competition, the European Cup, the next year. It was expanded and renamed in 1992 as the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool hold the English record, with six wins. Parallel to UEFA, various officials created the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1955, but this competition was disbanded when UEFA created the replacement tournament, UEFA Cup, in 1971 (renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009) The English record number of Europa League wins is three, also held by Liverpool. Another competition absorbed into the UEFA Cup, in 1999, was the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which was created in 1960 and featured the winners of national knockout competitions The winners of this competition played the European Cup winners in the UEFA Super Cup, starting in 1972 (recognised by UEFA in 1973), which now features the winners of the Champions League and Europa League.Liverpool also hold the English record, with four wins, in the UEFA Super Cup.

The tournament commenced in 1961, but UEFA officially recognised it only in 1995, and discontinued in 2008, with the Europa League expanded to accommodate Intertoto Cup clubs. UEFA and CONMEBOL also created an intercontinental competition in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup, featuring continental champions from both associations. In 2000, the international governing body FIFA created the FIFA Club World Cup and in 2004 the Intercontinental Cup was merged into it. Manchester United are the only English club to have won the Intercontinental Cup, while United, Chelsea and Liverpool are the only English teams to have lifted the Club World Cup.\n\nEngland's first competition organised by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871\u201372 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world.Arsenal hold the record number of wins, with 14. League football began in the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888\u201389. The name First Division was adopted in 1892, when The Football League gained a second division. The First Division remained the highest division of the English league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, 20. The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other. The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. Manchester United also hold the record here, with 21 wins. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup. Its current record is nine wins, held by Liverpool. The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976. In 1985, the Full Members' Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs. They finished in 1992 and 1986, respectively. The Football League Centenary Trophy marked The Football League's 100th birthday, in the 1988\u201389 season \n\nLower down in the hierarchy of English football are many other competitions, not included in the tables on this page. These include competitions run by the above national governing bodies, but organised for clubs ineligible for higher competitions. For example, the Texaco Cup and EFL Trophy. Regional competitions are organised by County Football Associations.

They were always trying to prove who was the fastest, the strongest, or the smartest. Among these animals were a hare and a tortoise.\n\nThe hare was known for his speed and agility. He would often boast about how fast he could run, making fun of the slow and steady tortoise. The tortoise, on the other hand, was humble and calm. He would never respond to the hare's taunts, knowing that actions speak louder than words.\n\nOne day, the hare challenged the tortoise to a race.

The news of the race spread throughout the village, and all the animals gathered to watch.\n\nAs the race began, the hare quickly sprinted ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. The hare was so confident in his speed that he decided to take a nap under a shady tree, thinking he could easily catch up later.\n\nMeanwhile, the tortoise continued to plod along at his own steady pace. He focused on each step, never wavering from his determined path. The other animals cheered for the tortoise, impressed by his perseverance.\n\nWhen the hare woke up from his nap, he was shocked to see the tortoise nearing the finish line. He sprinted as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise had already crossed the finish line, winning the race.\n\nThe moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race. The hare's overconfidence and arrogance had caused him to lose, while the tortoise's determination and perseverance had led him to victory. It teaches us the importance of consistency, patience, and not underestimating others.\n\nFrom that day forward, the animals in the village learned to appreciate each other's unique qualities and talents. They understood that it was not always about being the fastest or the strongest, but about staying committed and focused on their own journey.\n\nAnd so, the hare and the tortoise became good friends, reminding everyone that in life, it's not just about the destination, but also about the journey and the lessons learned along the way.", "One day a hare and a tortoise decided to race.

On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first, and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive pollen, then close during fertilization and maturation, and then re-open again at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6\u20138 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18\u201324 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and golden larch) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, cylindrical or ovoid (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2\u201360 cm long and 1\u201320 cm broad.\n\nAfter ripening, the opening of non-serotinous pine cones is associated with their moisture content\u2014cones are open when dry and closed when wet.

Curious, he tried the berries himself and experienced a similar boost in energy.\n\nFrom Ethiopia, the cultivation and consumption of coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula in the 15th century. Coffee houses, known as qahveh khaneh, became popular gathering places where people could socialize, discuss politics, and enjoy the beverage. Coffee soon became an integral part of Arabian culture.\n\nIn the 16th century, coffee made its way to Europe through trade routes. Initially, it faced resistance from religious authorities who considered it a \"Muslim drink\" and tried to ban it. However, its popularity grew, and coffee houses began to emerge across Europe. These coffee houses became important centers of intellectual and cultural exchange.\n\nCoffee cultivation expanded to various regions around the world during the colonial era. European powers established coffee plantations in their colonies, such as Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia, to meet the growing demand. This led to the rise of coffee as a major global commodity.\n\nIn the 20th century, coffee production and consumption continued to increase, and coffee became one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide. Different brewing methods, such as espresso and drip coffee, were developed, further enhancing the variety and enjoyment of coffee.\n\nToday, coffee is not only a popular beverage but also an important economic commodity, supporting millions of people's livelihoods around the world.

Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999.

However, many individuals argue that beach volleyball holds an edge over indoor volleyball for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, beach volleyball is played on sand, which adds an extra element of challenge and excitement to the game. The soft and uneven surface requires players to constantly adjust their movements, making the game more physically demanding and engaging. This aspect of beach volleyball not only tests the players' skills and agility but also adds a level of unpredictability to the game, making it more thrilling to watch.\n\nSecondly, the outdoor setting of beach volleyball provides a more natural and scenic backdrop compared to the indoor environment of traditional volleyball. Playing on the beach allows players to enjoy the fresh air, warm sunshine, and the soothing sound of crashing waves. This unique setting creates a more relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for both players and spectators, enhancing the overall experience of the game.\n\nAdditionally, beach volleyball is often played in pairs, which promotes a higher level of teamwork and communication between players. With only two players on each side, the game becomes more strategic and tactical, as players must rely on each other's strengths and cover more ground on the sand. This aspect of beach volleyball fosters a stronger sense of camaraderie and cooperation, adding another layer of excitement to the sport.\n\nLastly, beach volleyball is more accessible to a wider range of people. While indoor volleyball requires a dedicated court and specialized equipment, beach volleyball can be played on any sandy beach with minimal equipment. This accessibility makes beach volleyball a popular choice for casual players, families, and friends looking to have fun and stay active.\n\nIn conclusion, beach volleyball offers a unique and thrilling experience that sets it apart from indoor volleyball.

Research in the field of positive psychology has shown that simply being in/around nature can improve one's sense of well-being. Being able to exercise while feeling the sun on your back, hearing the birds chirp, and seeing people play around in the sand is a totally different experience than being stuck inside a dark building. Additionally, playing volleyball in the sand is way more difficult and a harder workout than playing on a court. In order to jump the same height or run after a shanked ball, you have to exert more energy.

Some 21st century mathematicians and physicists believe Tau is a better choice than Pi for use in science and mathematics.\n\nLike Pi, Tau is an irrational and transcendental number.  In decimal form, the value of Tau is 6.283185\u2026\n\nPart of the motivation for Tau is the observation that the number 2*Pi or 2\u03c0 occurs with surprising frequency throughout science and mathematics.  This raises the question of whether Pi is really an important number or something equal to two times Pi is actually more important.  Perhaps the implication is that Pi is exactly one half of some very important number!\n\nFurther consideration of the question leads to several compelling observations:\n\n\t- Using C/r as the key circle constant is better aligned with the way we define a circle: the set of all points a fixed distance (r) form a give point.\n\t- Radian angle measurements of fraction of a circle make much more sense when Tau is used as the base constant.  Using Pi, on quarter of a circle is Pi is Pi/2, one half is Pi, and the angle of a a full circle is 2*Pi.  With Tau, the angle measures are intuitively aligned to the fraction of a circle: a quarter circle is Tau/4, a half circle is Tau/2 and the angle of a full circle is Tau.  \n\t- Similarly, the radian zeroes, max, and min of the sin and cosine functions align to fractions of Tau in an intuitive fashion that aids, rather than confuses, understanding.\n\t- Key formulas that traditionally use Pi actually show more clear mathematical meaning when expressed using Tau.  For example, the area of a circle itself, when expressed with Tau, shows the same pattern of quadratic forms in distance fallen, spring energy, and kinetic energy.\n\t- Similarly, the tau-based formula for circular area actually confirms to the original proof by Archimedes showing that area of a circle equals the area of a triangle with base C (circumference) and height r (radius):  A = 1/2 b*h = 1/2 C*r = 1/2 (Tau*r)*r = 1/2 Tau*r^2.\n\n\nTau has seen significant adoption since it was originally proposed.  \n\nThe relationship between Tau and Pi is very simple.

Firstly, being a steward of capitalism helps to create a more stable and sustainable business environment. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and professor at New York University, argues that capitalism relies on trust and cooperation between individuals and organizations (Haidt, 2012). By actively participating in the stewardship of capitalism, managers can help build and maintain this trust, which in turn fosters a more stable and predictable business environment.\n\nSecondly, being a steward of capitalism allows private sector managers to contribute to the overall well-being of society. Haidt emphasizes the importance of moral foundations in shaping our social and economic systems (Haidt, 2012). By upholding ethical standards and promoting responsible business practices, managers can help create a more equitable and inclusive society. This not only benefits the broader community but also enhances the reputation and long-term success of their own businesses.\n\nFurthermore, being a steward of capitalism can lead to greater long-term profitability. Haidt argues that businesses that prioritize social and environmental responsibility often outperform their competitors (Haidt, 2012). By considering the broader impact of their actions and making sustainable choices, managers can build a loyal customer base, attract top talent, and mitigate risks associated with environmental and social challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being stewards of the institutions of capitalism because it promotes stability, contributes to societal well-being, and can lead to greater long-term profitability. By embracing their role as stewards, managers can help create a more sustainable and inclusive business environment, benefiting both their own organizations and society as a whole.\n\nCitations:\nHaidt, J.

Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.\n\nBut why should business leaders steward the market?

Pressure on employers to increase wages and on lawmakers to enact worker-friendly measures declined. Rewards from productivity gains went to executives, investors and creditors. A study by Kristal and Cohen reported that rising wage inequality was driven more by declining unions and the fall in the real value of the minimum wage, with twice as much impact as technology. An alternative theory states that passthrough income's contribution is incorrectly attributed to capital rather than labor.\nglobalization \u2013 Low skilled American workers lost ground in the face of competition from low-wage workers in Asia and other \"emerging\" economies.\nskill-biased technological change \u2013 Rapid progress in information technology increased the demand for skilled and educated workers.\nsuperstars \u2013 Modern communication technologies often turn competition into a \"winner take most\" tournament in which the winner is richly rewarded, while the runners-up get far less.\nfinancialization \u2013 In the 1990s stock market capitalization rose from 55% to 155% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Corporations began to shift executive compensation toward stock options, increasing incentives for managers to make decisions to increase share prices. Average annual CEO options increased from $500,000 to over $3 million. Stock comprised almost 50% of CEO compensation. Managers were incentivized to increase shareholder wealth rather than to improve long-term contracts with workers; between 2000 and 2007, nearly 75% of increased stock growth came at the cost of labor wages and salaries.\nimmigration of less-educated workers \u2013 Relatively high levels of immigration of low skilled workers since 1965 may have reduced wages for American-born high school dropouts;\ncollege premium - Workers with college degrees traditionally earned more and faced a lower unemployment rate than others. Wealthy families are also more likely to send their children to schools which have large endowments, resulting in more grants and lower student debt. The cycle is completed when wealthier alums donate more and disproportionately increase the size of elite endowments. Elite colleges also have better access to financial expertise.\nautomation - The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that increased automation had led to \"an overall drop in the need for labor input. This would cause capital share to increase, relative to labor share, as machines replace some workers.\"\nWe haven't achieved the minimalist state that libertarians advocate. What we've achieved is a state too constrained to provide the public goods \u2013 investments in infrastructure, technology, and education \u2013 that would make for a vibrant economy and too weak to engage in the redistribution that is needed to create a fair society. But we have a state that is still large enough and distorted enough that it can provide a bounty of gifts to the wealthy.\n\n\u2014Joseph Stiglitz\npolicy \u2013 Krugman asserted that movement conservatives increased their influence over the Republican Party beginning in the 1970s. In the same era, it increased its political power. The result was less progressive tax laws, anti-labor policies, and slower expansion of the welfare state relative to other developed nations (e.g., the unique absence of universal healthcare). Further, variation in income inequality across developed countries indicate that policy has a significant influence on inequality; Japan, Sweden and France have income inequality around 1960 levels. The US was an early adopter of neoliberalism, whose focus on growth over equality spread to other countries over time.\ncorporatism and corpocracy \u2013 Excessive attention to the interests of corporations reduced scrutiny over compensation shifts.\nfemale labor force participation \u2013 High earning households are more likely to be dual earner households.\nstock ownership is tilted towards households at higher income and education levels, resulting in disparate investment income.\nHigher income households are disproportionately likely to prosper when economic times are good, and to suffer losses during downturns. More of their income comes from relatively volatile capital income. For example, in 2011 the top 1% of income earners derived 37% of their income from labor, versus 62% for the middle quintile. The top 1% derived 58% of their income from capital as opposed to 4% for the middle quintile. Government transfers represented only 1% of the income of the top 1% but 25% for the middle quintile; the dollar amounts of these transfers tend to rise in recessions.\n\nAccording to a 2018 report by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the US has higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low income workers than almost any other advanced nation because unemployed and at-risk workers get less support from the government and a weak collective bargaining system.", "output": ["The text lists the following as causes of income inequality in the United States: decline of labor unions, globalization, skill-biased technological change, superstars, financialization, immigration of less-educated workers, college premium, automation, public policy, corporatism and corpocracy, female labor force participation, and disproportionate stock ownership in households at higher income and education levels.", "decline of labor unions, globalization, skill-biased technological change, superstars, financialization, immigration of less-educated workers, college premium, automation, policy, corporatism and corpocracy, female labor force participation, stock ownership"]}, {"instruction": "Who was Calvin Parker MacDonald", "input": "", "output": ["Calvin Parker MacDonald (June 14, 1933 \u2014 August 17, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who played for five National Hockey League teams between 1953 and 1969.

The panel is made up of multiple layers, including a backlight, polarizing filters, liquid crystal cells, and color filters.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of how it works:\n\n1. Backlight: The LCD panel is illuminated by a backlight, usually a fluorescent lamp or LED, which provides the light source for the display.\n\n2. Polarizing Filters: Two polarizing filters are placed on either side of the LCD panel. These filters only allow light waves vibrating in a specific direction to pass through.\n\n3. Liquid Crystal Cells: The liquid crystal cells are located between the polarizing filters. These cells contain liquid crystals that can change their alignment when an electric current is applied.\n\n4. Electric Current: When an electric current is applied to the liquid crystal cells, the crystals align in a specific way, either allowing light to pass through or blocking it.\n\n5. Color Filters: Color filters are placed on top of the liquid crystal cells to create the desired colors. These filters allow only specific colors of light to pass through.\n\n6. Image Creation: By controlling the alignment of the liquid crystals in each cell, the LCD panel can create different shades and colors. This creates the images and videos that we see on the screen.\n\nOverall, the LCD panel uses the properties of liquid crystals and polarizing filters to control the passage of light and create the display we see on our devices.", "LCD stands for liquid crystal display.

This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\n\nJacques Villeneuve qualifying at the 2005 United States Grand Prix in his Sauber C24\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989. However, street races like Monaco have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\n\nThroughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies.\n\nUnder wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change.

Provide anecdotes to support your points.", "input": "", "output": ["The concept of \"work from home\" does indeed have an opportunity cost. Opportunity cost refers to the potential benefits or opportunities that are forgone when choosing one alternative over another. In the case of working from home, there are several factors that can contribute to opportunity costs.\n\nOne of the main opportunity costs of working from home is the lack of face-to-face interaction and collaboration with colleagues. While remote work offers flexibility and convenience, it can also result in reduced social interaction and limited access to in-person brainstorming sessions or team meetings. This can have an impact on the exchange of ideas and the overall productivity of a team. For example, a study conducted by Harvard Business Review found that employees who work remotely tend to have fewer chances for spontaneous interactions, which can hinder creativity and innovation.\n\nAnother opportunity cost of working from home is the potential blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. When the office is just a few steps away, it can be challenging to establish a clear separation between work and personal time. This can lead to longer working hours, increased stress, and a negative impact on work-life balance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some individuals find it difficult to switch off from work when their home becomes their office, resulting in burnout and reduced overall well-being.\n\nAdditionally, working from home may limit career advancement opportunities. In some industries, being physically present in the office can provide employees with more visibility and networking opportunities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that individuals who work remotely may have limited access to informal conversations, networking events, or mentorship opportunities that can contribute to career growth. This can potentially impact their chances of promotions or new job opportunities.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the opportunity costs of working from home can vary depending on the individual and the nature of their work. Some individuals may thrive in a remote work environment and find that the benefits outweigh the opportunity costs. It is also worth mentioning that advancements in technology and the increasing acceptance of remote work by employers have mitigated some of these opportunity costs.\n\nIn conclusion, while working from home offers numerous benefits, it is important to recognize that it also comes with opportunity costs. The lack of face-to-face interaction, potential blurring of boundaries, and limited career advancement opportunities are some factors that can contribute to these opportunity costs. However, with proper planning and adaptation, individuals can mitigate these costs and make the most of the work-from-home arrangement.", "These days, it is \u201ccool\u201d to be a techie. Jobs come with perks, including nap rooms and free gourmet lunches. Celebrity entrepreneurs, like Mark Cuban, talk about how they are learning to write code. Back in the late 1990s when I started getting paid to write code, this was not the case. I often found myself in windowless rooms, basements or chilly server rooms wrangling data or writing code. However, from early on in my career, my managers ensured that I was exposed to the real action: where the business value-add activities took place. I walked factory floors at Prestolite in Ann Arbor to see how the ERP system for which I was contributing programming code played a part in the convergence of IT with humans working with machines and parts to produce finished products. When I worked for Richard Helppie\u2019s Superior Consultant Holdings Corporation, while between programming assignments, I shadowed an industrial engineer who was helping to redesign an Emergency Department\u2019s (ED) physical layout; we watched the flow of doctors, patients and nurses. We asked questions like: \u201cwhy are the doctors not using the stations intended for note-taking and instead are walking down two hallways to take their notes in empty offices?\u201d; it turned out that the note-taking station in the heart of the ED was a place where doctors were exposed to all sorts of noise and other distractions.\n\nBeing a good programmer had a lot to do with understanding software architecture, APIs, etc\u2026 But being a better programmer meant understanding the world in which the software was actually put into practice. \n\nFord Motor Company\u2019s F-150 has been America\u2019s best selling truck for 46 consecutive years. Looking at the finished product with your eyes barely conveys the awesome complexity of the supply chain involved in bringing it to life. To get a better sense of the convergence of the F-150\u2019s supply chain into its finished product, you can take a stroll on the catwalk that hovers above the assembly line as part of the Ford Rouge Factory Tour. The public can tour the plant and walk above a large portion of the assembly process. You can see Kanban in action as workers pull components from bins and perform their specialized task in a step of the ever-rolling line, while overhead displays help orchestrate replenishment. You can get a sense of the optimized flows of humans, robots and parts. And, maybe, if you look closely, you\u2019ll spot opportunities for improvements in the process, in the safety measures, or in areas where automation has not yet taken hold. Consider whether or not you would see such opportunities by looking at charts and graphs\u2026\n\nAlan Mulally was figuratively and literally a gymnast (at least during his time at the University of Kansas). After taking over the reins as CEO of Ford in 2006, he famously transformed a culture with deep-rooted divisional fiefdoms that hindered communication, reporting, efficiency and agility into a new era of quality, efficiency and innovation. A disciplined engineer by training, he did not solely rely on charts, facts and figures to drive organizational change. He used his eyes and made sure that the leaders saw the firm\u2019s operations in a certain, methodical way. For instance, he built trust through transparency by using simple visual tools (like color-coding for status). \n\nOnce Mulally brought divisional leaders together to a conference room to look at a pile of hood prop rods for the various cars and trucks that Ford manufactures. The prop rods all looked different. They were from different suppliers, made of different materials, had a variety of costs, and had different internal staff dedicated to their role in the supply chain and assembly. He did not send a spreadsheet in an email to make his point. He had the leadership team look at the rods on the table and aimed for them to understand that \u201cthis kind of variation is costly but doesn\u2019t matter to consumers.\u201d\n\nMulally performed organizational and operational gymnastics, starting with a junk-rated company, and ending up being called \u201cThe Savior of Ford\u201d. Mulally understood the power of seeing and of showing.\n\nIn the 1970s, Japan rocked the automotive world by mass producing high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles at highly competitive prices. The Toyota way eventually swept across the industry, and a new jargon (and mindset) made its way to Detroit, with terms like Kaizen, Kanban, and Genchi Genbutsu. The Gemba Walk made its way into automotive manufacturing and other industries, such as Overhead Door and at the COVID-19 vaccination center at Mount Morningside Hospital in New York City. \u201cThe literal translation for Gemba (\u73fe\u5834) is \u2018the real place\u2019 and in business it refers to the real place where value is created, such as the factory floor.\u201d These tools are not a magic bullet; a Harvard Business Review study found that MBWA (\u201cmanagement by walking around\u201d) decreased performance, on average, in a hospital setting. \n\nI used aspects of the Gemba Walk to help design a software system for lab technicians at a major national laboratory. When the CDC needed help to track the variants of the SARS-Cov-2 (\u201cCoronavirus\u201d) across the USA, I helped build a system that enabled lab technicians to efficiently select and route the appropriate samples for the genetic sequencing process, a step that comes after the COVID PCR test. I went to the lab, watched the technicians, observed the physical flow of humans and materials in the lab and talked with the people involved in the process. I was able to see (and measure) aspects of the process that I was tasked with automating. I made observations that I never could have made through video calls or emails.\n\nSoftware practitioners (developers, designers, architects, UX engineers and product owners) are continuously building and refining systems for robotics, assembly lines, labs, logistics, warehouses, shipyards, and other industries. \u201cAgile\u201d software development is a common methodology (and has some roots that are tied to Toyota-inspired manufacturing practices). Agile facilitates frequent, structured communication, but the product owner often serves as a proxy for the actual business stakeholders. He or she may communicate with slides, diagrams and customer \u201cuser stories\u201d. However, as the value chain is communicated through the various parties (product owner, architect, etc.), the real-world value chain (what does the assembly line actually look like when it is in full swing) can become distilled and distorted.\n\nExecutives and senior managers are keenly monitoring the Work from Home (WFH) phenomenon. The U.S. Census Bureau is tracking WFH trends. Academics are analyzing WFH. Celebrity executives are flip-flopping on WFH. Productivity is questioned. But, are we asking the right question? Can you WFH and walk?\n\nIt is clear that IT and non-IT professionals prefer WFH\u2026 So companies are in a bind: force in-office work or find some middle ground. A.P.

A Global Newswire article from January, 2023 describes Gemba\u2019s origin story: \u201cGemba grew out of executive training company The Leadership Network, founded in 2013 by CEO Nathan Robinson and Chairman Victor Lewis. Through its collaboration with global giants like Toyota, Tesla, Google, BMW and Amazon, senior executives from non-competing companies have been able to visit their state-of-the-art factories and facilities to see best practice in action as part of an executive Gemba masterclass.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if technology will allow techies like myself to continue to work in our pajamas while getting the benefits of a Gemba Walk.

However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.\n\nISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:\n\nSystematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nDesign and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and\nAdopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.\nWhat controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively.\n\nManagement determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management.\n\nOther standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).", "output": ["The ISO 27001 standard is an international standard that provides a framework for organizations to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an information security management system (ISMS). It helps organizations systematically examine their information security risks, design and implement appropriate controls to address those risks, and establish a management process to ensure that the controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs.\n\nThe standard requires management to identify and assess information security risks, considering threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts. Based on this assessment, organizations must implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls or other risk treatment measures to address unacceptable risks. These controls can include technical, physical, and operational measures.\n\nCertification to ISO 27001 involves an audit process where the certification auditor tests the implemented controls to ensure they are operating effectively. The scope of the certification can be determined by the organization, which may limit it to a specific business unit or location. It's important to note that ISO 27001 certification for a specific scope does not guarantee that the rest of the organization has adequate information security management practices.\n\nThe ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards also includes additional guidance on various aspects of designing, implementing, and operating an ISMS, such as information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).", "The ISO 27001 standard works by requiring management of the information security management system to examine security risks, implement a comprehensive suite of security controls to manage the identified risks, and operate ongoing processes to measure control effectiveness and risk levels."]}, {"instruction": "Who designed the South African Class 15E 4-8-2 locomotive?", "input": "The Class 15E 4-8-2 Mountain type mixed traffic steam locomotive was a refinement of the Classes 15C and 15CA.

Prepare examples that demonstrate your leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.\n\n6. Network with consultants: Reach out to current or former consultants to gain insights into the firm's interview process. They can provide valuable advice and help you understand what the firm is looking for in candidates.\n\n7. Mock interviews: Practice mock interviews with friends, family, or career counselors. This will help you become more comfortable with the interview format and receive feedback on your performance.\n\n8. Dress professionally: Dress appropriately for the interview, following the firm's dress code. It is better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.\n\nRemember, preparation is key to perform well in consulting firm interviews. Good luck!", "Use case study books that are available to practice the case studies in interviews. Often the business schools will have copies of the case study material. In addition, there will be a leadership assessment that is done using examples of projects executed by the interviewee.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "output": ["Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.

Different materials have different conductivities, which determine how easily electric current can flow through them. For example, metals are good conductors of electricity, while insulators do not allow the flow of electric current.\n\nIn engineering and household applications, current is often categorized as either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). DC is a unidirectional flow of current, meaning it flows in one direction only.

The elder's eyes sparkled with a deep sense of understanding and compassion. Jacob greeted him respectfully and sat down beside him, his heart brimming with anticipation.\n\n\"Uncle William,\" Jacob began, \"I have been contemplating my purpose and how I can make a meaningful impact in the world. I feel a deep connection to our people and our land, but I am unsure of the path I should take.\"\n\nUncle William smiled gently, his weathered face reflecting a lifetime of experience.

It is natural to seek your place in the world, especially when you feel a strong connection to your roots.\"\n\nHe continued, \"To find your purpose, you must first listen to the whispers of the land.

He modified the pickups on his first Strat, putting a Gibson pickup at the neck and a Telecaster pickup at the bridge, while leaving the Stratocaster pickup in the middle. Randy favored Stratocasters and custom Strat-style guitars throughout his years with BTO.

The Republican Party won control of the presidency, and picked up seats in the House and Senate, although the Democratic Party retained control of Congress.\n\nIn the presidential election, Republican former Vice President Richard Nixon defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Nixon won the popular vote by less than one point, but took most states outside the Northeast, and comfortably won the electoral vote. Former Alabama Governor George Wallace, of the American Independent Party, took 13.5% of the popular vote, and won the electoral votes of the Deep South. After incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson declined to seek re-election, Humphrey won the Democratic nomination over Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and South Dakota Senator George McGovern at the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention. Nixon won the Republican nomination over New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan. As of 2022, Wallace is the most recent third-party candidate to win a state's entire share of electoral votes. Nixon became the first former (non-sitting) vice president to win a presidential election; he was the only person to achieve that until former Vice President Joe Biden won the 2020 Presidential election.\n\nThe Republican Party won a net gain of five seats in both the House and the Senate. However, the Democratic Party retained strong majorities in both houses of Congress. In the gubernatorial elections, the Republican Party picked up a net gain of five governorships.

Mathematical Complexity: Quantum theory relies heavily on complex mathematical equations and calculations. Understanding and applying these mathematical concepts can be daunting for those without a strong background in mathematics.\n\n3. Uncertainty Principle: The uncertainty principle, a fundamental principle in quantum theory, states that there are inherent limits to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known simultaneously. This principle challenges our classical understanding of determinism and predictability.\n\n4. Quantum Superposition: Quantum superposition is the idea that particles can exist in multiple states or locations at the same time until observed. This concept can be difficult to conceptualize, as it goes against our classical notion of objects having definite states.\n\n5. Quantum Entanglement: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This non-locality and instantaneous correlation between particles can be hard to comprehend.\n\n6. Lack of Visual Representations: Quantum phenomena often occur at extremely small scales, making them difficult to observe directly. Unlike classical physics, where we can rely on visual representations and analogies, quantum theory lacks such easily relatable visualizations, making it more abstract and challenging to grasp.\n\nIt's important to note that while quantum theory may be difficult to understand, it has been extensively tested and proven to accurately describe the behavior of particles at the quantum level.", "1.

Here are the basic steps to building a roof:\n\n1. Build out the shape of the roof with a wood frame. This is the roof's skeleton.\n2. Cover the frame with decking. Decking is the first layer of the roof. It's a thin piece of wood that all the other material will rest on. \n3. Add an underlayment on top of the decking. This is a synthetic barrier that guards against water and fire, and helps the roof maintain its shape if the wood under it expands or contracts.\n4. Add flashing around vertical elements on the roof. Flashing is a thin sheet of metal that prevents water from getting into gaps around vertical elements like chimneys and vents.\n5. Apply shingles to the roof.

Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.\n\nAmong the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth. His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries. He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nJefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\n\nJefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism, and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.\n\nSince the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.\n\nAfter retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents of American history.", "Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 \u2013 July 4, 1826) was an American statesman and Founding Father.

In childhood, these occupations may include play, school and learning self-care tasks. An entry level Occupational Therapist can provide treatment for sensory processing disorder however, more advanced clinical training exists to target the underlying neuro-biological processes involved. \nSensory integration therapy is driven by four main principles:\nJust right challenge (the child must be able to successfully meet the challenges that are presented through playful activities)\nAdaptive response (the child adapts their behavior with new and useful strategies in response to the challenges presented)\nActive engagement (the child will want to participate because the activities are fun)\nChild directed (the child's preferences are used to initiate therapeutic experiences within the session)\nSerious questions have been raised as to the effectiveness of this therapy particularly in medical journals where the requirements for a treatment to be effective is much higher and developed than it's occupational therapy counter parts which often advocate the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n\nSensory processing therapy\nThis therapy retains all of the above-mentioned four principles and adds:\nIntensity (person attends therapy daily for a prolonged period of time)\nDevelopmental approach (therapist adapts to the developmental age of the person, against actual age)\nTest-retest systematic evaluation (all clients are evaluated before and after)\nProcess driven vs. activity driven (therapist focuses on the \"just right\" emotional connection and the process that reinforces the relationship)\nParent education (parent education sessions are scheduled into the therapy process)\n\"Joie de vivre\" (happiness of life is therapy's main goal, attained through social participation, self-regulation, and self-esteem)\nCombination of best practice interventions (is often accompanied by integrated listening system therapy, floor time, and electronic media such as Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, Makoto II machine training and others)\nWhile occupational therapists using a sensory integration frame of reference work on increasing a child's ability to adequately process sensory input, other OTs may focus on environmental accommodations that parents and school staff can use to enhance the child's function at home, school, and in the community.These may include selecting soft, tag-free clothing, avoiding fluorescent lighting, and providing ear plugs for \"emergency\" use (such as for fire drills)\nEvaluation of treatment effectiveness\nA 2019 review found sensory integration therapy to be effective for autism spectrum disorder.Another study from 2018 backs up the intervention for children with special needs,Additionally, the American Occupational Therapy Association supports the intervention.\nIn its overall review of the treatment effectiveness literature, Aetna concluded that \"The effectiveness of these therapies is unproven\",while the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that \"parents should be informed that the amount of research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive.\"A 2015 review concluded that SIT techniques exist \"outside the bounds of established evidence-based practice\" and that SIT is \"quite possibly a misuse of limited resources.\"", "output": ["The available treatments for Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) typically involve occupational therapy.

The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.\n\nLateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.\n\nThe best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum, this is the same body side, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.\n\nLanguage functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right-handed individuals. While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handers, it is more bilateral, or even right-lateralized, in approximately 50% of left-handers.\n\nBroca's area and Wernicke's area, associated with the production of speech and comprehension of speech, respectively, are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers but about 70% of left-handers. 69\u200a Individuals who speak multiple languages demonstrate separate speech areas for each language.\n\nThe processing of basic sensory information is lateralized by being divided into left and right sides of the body or the space around the body.\n\nIn vision, about half the neurons of the optic nerve from each eye cross to project to the opposite hemisphere, and about half do not cross to project to the hemisphere on the same side. This means that the left side of the visual field is processed largely by the visual cortex of the right hemisphere and vice versa for the right side of the visual field.\n\nIn hearing, about 90% of the neurons of the auditory nerve from one ear cross to project to the auditory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.\n\nIn the sense of touch, most of the neurons from the skin cross to project to the somatosensory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.\n\nBecause of this functional division of the left and right sides of the body and of the space that surrounds it, the processing of information in the sensory cortices is essentially identical. That is, the processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception, and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing.\n\nRather than just being a series of places where different brain modules occur, there are running similarities in the kind of function seen in each side, for instance how right-side impairment of drawing ability making patients draw the parts of the subject matter with wholly incoherent relationships, or where the kind of left-side damage seen in language impairment not damaging the patient's ability to catch the significance of intonation in speech. This has led British psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist to view the two hemispheres as having different value systems, where the left hemisphere tends to reduce complex matters such as ethics to rules and measures, and the right hemisphere is disposed to the holistic and metaphorical.\n\nDepression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere. The delusional misidentification syndromes, reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions.\n\nDamage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Left hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has grave effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts, and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, people with right hemisphere damage often exhibit discourse that is abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge.\n\nLateral brain damage can also affect visual perceptual spatial resolution. People with left hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of high resolution, or detailed, aspects of an image. People with right hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of low resolution, or big picture, aspects of an image.\n\nIf a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.\n\nBroca's aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca's area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca's area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called 'non-fluent' due to the issues that arise because Broca's area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in specific non-fluent aphasia.\n\nWernicke's aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the Sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke's aphasia is riddled with semantic errors and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke's aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making.\n\nTerence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and neurolinguistic programming, brain-training equipment, or management training.\n\nSome popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. Interestingly, research has shown quite opposite function of brain lateralisation, i.e. left hemisphere creatively and chaotically links between concepts and right hemisphere tends to adhere to specific date and time, although generally adhering to the pattern of left-brain as linguistic interpretation and right brain as spatio-temporal.\n\nIn the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.", "The right and left sides of the brain are responsible for different functions and have distinct roles in cognitive processes. This is known as the lateralization of brain function. While the macrostructure of the two hemispheres may appear similar, the composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized functions that differ in each hemisphere.\n\nThe left side of the brain is typically associated with language processing, logical reasoning, and analytical thinking. It is often referred to as the \"logical\" or \"analytical\" side. It controls the right side of the body.\n\nThe right side of the brain, on the other hand, is often associated with creativity, imagination, spatial awareness, and holistic thinking. It is often referred to as the \"creative\" or \"artistic\" side. It controls the left side of the body.\n\nIt's important to note that while certain functions are typically associated with each hemisphere, the brain is highly interconnected, and both sides work together to perform complex tasks. The division of functions between the two hemispheres is not absolute, and there can be variations in lateralization among individuals."]}, {"instruction": "What kind of food comprises Estonian cuisine?", "input": "Traditional Estonian cuisine has substantially been based on meat and potatoes, and on fish in coastal and lakeside areas, but now bears influence from many other cuisines, including a variety of international foods and dishes, with a number of contributions from the traditions of nearby countries.

Place your plants in locations where they can receive the appropriate amount of light based on their specific needs. Some plants prefer bright, indirect light, while others may require more direct sunlight.\n\n2. Water Properly: Watering your houseplants correctly is crucial. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot and other issues. Instead, water your plants when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Ensure that the water drains properly and does not accumulate in the pot.\n\n3. Maintain Proper Humidity: Indoor environments can often be drier than what some plants prefer. To increase humidity, you can mist your plants regularly, place a tray of water near them, or use a humidifier. Be mindful of the specific humidity requirements of your plants, as some may prefer drier conditions.\n\n4. Fertilize Regularly: Houseplants benefit from regular fertilization to provide them with essential nutrients. Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer and follow the instructions on the packaging. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it can cause damage to the plant's roots.\n\n5. Monitor for Pests and Diseases: Regularly inspect your houseplants for signs of pests, such as aphids, mealybugs, or spider mites. If you notice any infestation, take appropriate measures to control and eliminate the pests. Additionally, keep an eye out for any signs of diseases, such as leaf spots or wilting, and address them promptly.\n\nRemember, each plant may have specific care requirements, so it's essential to research and understand the needs of your specific houseplants.", "1. Get on a watering schedule so you can make sure you are not over-watering or under-watering the plants. \n2.

At that time, an estimated four million African Americans were set free.\n\nSupport for reparations\nWithin the political sphere, a bill demanding slavery reparations has been proposed at the national level, the \"Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act,\" which former Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-MI) reintroduced to the United States Congress every year from 1989 until his resignation in 2017. As its name suggests, the bill recommended the creation of a commission to study the \"impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of our nation\"., however there are cities and institutions which have initiated reparations in the US (see \u00a7 Legislation and other actions for a list).\n\nIn 1999, African-American lawyer and activist Randall Robinson, founder of the TransAfrica advocacy organization, wrote that America's history of race riots, lynching, and institutional discrimination have \"resulted in $1.4 trillion in losses for African Americans\".

However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole.", "The last step before a star collapses into a black hole is a supernova explosion.

At Wimbledon, 39-year-old Federer advanced to the quarterfinals and thus became the oldest Wimbledon quarterfinalist in the Open Era, breaking the record held by Ken Rosewall, following wins over Adrian Mannarino by retirement, Richard Gasquet, 29th seed Cameron Norrie, and 23rd seed Lorenzo Sonego. However, he was then upset by 14th seed Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinal in straight sets. This was the first time in 19 years at Wimbledon he had lost in straight sets, and only the second time he had lost a set 6\u20130 in the 21st century (the previous occasion was against Nadal in the 2008 French Open final).\n\nOn 15 August, Federer announced that he underwent another knee surgery after further injury during the grass court season.

His home and birthplace at 2639 Monmouth Avenue has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. He was a member of a prominent Illinois political family. His grandfather and namesake Adlai Stevenson I was Vice President of the United States under President Grover Cleveland from 1893 to 1897. His father, Lewis Stevenson, never held an elected office, but was appointed Illinois Secretary of State (1914\u20131917) and was considered a strong contender for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1928. A maternal great-grandfather, Jesse W. Fell, had been a close friend and campaign manager for Abraham Lincoln in his 1858 US Senate race; Stevenson often referred to Fell as his favorite ancestor. Stevenson's eldest son, Adlai E. Stevenson III, became a U.S. Senator from Illinois (1970\u20131981). His mother was Helen Davis Stevenson, and he had an older sister, Elizabeth Stevenson Ives, an author who was called \"Buffie\". Actor McLean Stevenson was a second cousin once removed. He was the nephew by marriage of novelist Mary Borden, and she assisted in the writing of some of his political speeches.\n\nStevenson was raised in the city of Bloomington, Illinois; his family was a member of Bloomington's upper class and lived in one of the city's well-to-do neighborhoods. On December 30, 1912, at the age of twelve, Stevenson accidentally killed Ruth Merwin, a 16-year-old friend, while demonstrating drill technique with a rifle, inadvertently left loaded, during a party at the Stevenson home. Stevenson was devastated by the accident and rarely mentioned or discussed it as an adult, even with his wife and children. However, in 1955 Stevenson heard about a woman whose son had experienced a similar tragedy. He wrote to her that she should tell her son that \"he must now live for two\", which Stevenson's friends took to be a reference to the shooting incident.\n\nStevenson left Bloomington High School after his junior year and attended University High School in Normal, Illinois, Bloomington's \"twin city\", just to the north. He then went to boarding school in Connecticut at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall), where he played on the tennis team, acted in plays, and was elected editor-in-chief of The Choate News, the school newspaper. Upon his graduation from Choate in 1918, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve and served at the rank of seaman apprentice, but his training was completed too late for him to participate in World War I.\n\nHe attended Princeton University, becoming managing editor of The Daily Princetonian, a member of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, a member of the Quadrangle Club, and received a B.A. degree in 1922 in literature and history. Under prodding from his father he then went to Harvard Law School, but found the law to be \"uninteresting\", and withdrew after failing several classes. He returned to Bloomington where he wrote for the family newspaper, The Daily Pantagraph, which was founded by his maternal great-grandfather Jesse Fell. The Pantagraph, which had one of the largest circulations of any newspaper in Illinois outside the Chicago area, was a main source of the Stevenson family's wealth. Following his mother's death in 1935, Adlai inherited one-quarter of the Pantagraph's stock, providing him with a large, dependable source of income for the rest of his life.\n\nA year after leaving Harvard, Stevenson became interested in the law again after talking to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. When he returned home to Bloomington, he decided to finish his degree at Northwestern University School of Law, attending classes during the week and returning to Bloomington on the weekends to write for the Pantagraph.

The overall cleanliness of the place was subpar, and some areas felt neglected. Additionally, the kitchen was poorly equipped, with limited utensils and cookware available. This made it challenging to prepare meals, especially for those who prefer to cook during their travels.\n\nFurthermore, the bathroom amenities were far from satisfactory. The towels provided were worn out and had seen better days. The lack of toiletries and basic essentials, such as soap and shampoo, was disappointing. It would have been nice to have these provided, especially for guests who are traveling light and rely on these amenities.\n\nAnother issue I encountered was the lack of proper heating or cooling options. The room was uncomfortably cold during my stay, and there were no extra blankets or heaters available to alleviate the chill. This made for an uncomfortable night's sleep.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I must acknowledge that the host was responsive and accommodating.

The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding. Hopefully these tips help you to have a fruitful growing season!", "Growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest can present several challenges due to the region's cooler and wetter climate. However, there are solutions available to overcome these challenges. \n\nOne challenge is the relatively short growing season in the Pacific Northwest. Tomatoes require warm temperatures to thrive, and the region's cooler climate can limit the growing season. To address this, you can start tomato plants indoors early in the season and transplant them outside once the weather warms up. This allows you to extend the growing period and give the plants a head start.\n\nAnother challenge is the high humidity and rainfall in the Pacific Northwest, which can lead to fungal diseases such as blight. To combat this, it is important to choose tomato varieties that are resistant to common fungal diseases in the region. Additionally, providing good air circulation around the plants by spacing them adequately and removing any diseased foliage can help reduce the risk of fungal infections.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest also experiences cool summer nights, which can hinder tomato fruit set and ripening. To address this, you can use techniques such as mulching around the plants to retain heat, using row covers or cloches to provide additional warmth, or even growing tomatoes in containers that can be moved to sunnier spots during the day.\n\nLastly, the region's acidic soil can pose a challenge for growing tomatoes. Tomatoes prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 6.8. If your soil is too acidic, you can amend it by adding lime or wood ash to raise the pH level. Regular soil testing can help you monitor and adjust the pH as needed.\n\nBy taking these challenges into consideration and implementing the appropriate solutions, you can successfully grow tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest."]}, {"instruction": "Please give me an example of this phenomenon that I can understand as a layman.", "input": "In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.", "output": ["An example of aliasing that easy to understand as a layman is the 'wagon wheel effect'. You've probably seen the wagon wheel effect when watching a movie or tv show and the wheels of a car appear to be spinning backwards even as the car moves forwards. This is an effect of aliasing. This occurs because the sampling rate of the film is not adequate to capture the frequency of the signal (the frequency that the tires are spinning forwards) and the signal becomes indistinguishable from another signal (a frequency of the tires spinning backwards). As an example of how this happens imagine that the camera's sampling rate allows it to record an image frame at about 90% of the frequency that the tires are spinning. That is, the tire is spinning fast enough that it rotates 90% around in between each picture the camera can take. In this case, the wheel will look like its rotated backwards by 10% of a rotation on each image. When you put these images together in a film, the tires will appear to be rotating backwards.", "Sure! Let me explain aliasing in a way that is easier to understand. \n\nImagine you are watching a movie that is playing in slow motion. When the movie is played at a slower speed, you might notice that some fast-moving objects appear to move in a strange and unnatural way. This happens because the camera capturing the movie is taking fewer frames per second, causing the fast-moving objects to be \"aliased\" or misrepresented in the final footage.\n\nIn signal processing, aliasing is similar. When we sample a signal (like taking snapshots of a continuous signal at regular intervals), we might miss important details or information. This can cause different signals to look the same or become indistinguishable from each other, just like the fast-moving objects in the movie. The reconstructed signal from these samples may then differ from the original continuous signal, creating distortions or artifacts.\n\nI hope this example helps you understand aliasing better!

Cyclo-cross eventually became a sport in its own right in the 1940s, with the first world championship taking place in 1950.\n\nThe Rough Stuff Fellowship was established in 1955 by off-road cyclists in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Oregon in 1966, one Chemeketan club member, D. Gwynn, built a rough terrain trail bicycle. He named it a \"mountain bicycle\" for its intended place of use. This may be the first use of that name.\n\nIn England in 1968, Geoff Apps, a motorbike trials rider, began experimenting with off-road bicycle designs. By 1979 he had developed a custom-built lightweight bicycle which was uniquely suited to the wet and muddy off-road conditions found in the south-east of England. They were designed around 2 inch x 650b Nokian snow tires though a 700x47c (28 in.) version was also produced. These were sold under the Cleland Cycles brand until late 1984. Bikes based on the Cleland design were also sold by English Cycles and Highpath Engineering until the early 1990s.\n\n1970s\u20131980s\nThere were several groups of riders in different areas of the U.S.A. who can make valid claims to playing a part in the birth of the sport. Riders in Crested Butte, Colorado, and Mill Valley, California, tinkered with bikes and adapted them to the rigors of off-road riding. Modified heavy cruiser bicycles, old 1930s and '40s Schwinn bicycles retrofitted with better brakes and fat tires, were used for freewheeling down mountain trails in Marin County, California, in the mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, there were no mountain bikes. The earliest ancestors of modern mountain bikes were based around frames from cruiser bicycles such as those made by Schwinn. The Schwinn Excelsior was the frame of choice due to its geometry. Riders used balloon-tired cruisers and modified them with gears and motocross or BMX-style handlebars, creating \"klunkers\". The term would also be used as a verb since the term \"mountain biking\" was not yet in use. The first person known to fit multiple speeds and drum brakes to a klunker is Russ Mahon of Cupertino, California, who used the resulting bike in cyclo-cross racing. Riders would race down mountain fire roads, causing the hub brake to burn the grease inside, requiring the riders to repack the bearings. These were called \"Repack Races\" and triggered the first innovations in mountain bike technology as well as the initial interest of the public (on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin CA, there is still a trail titled \"Repack\"\u2014in reference to these early competitions). The sport originated in California on Marin County's Mount Tamalpais.\n\nIt was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials. Joe Breeze is normally credited with introducing the first purpose-built mountain bike in 1978. Tom Ritchey then went on to make frames for a company called MountainBikes, a partnership between Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly and Tom Ritchey. Tom Ritchey, a welder with skills in frame building, also built the original bikes. The company's three partners eventually dissolved their partnership, and the company became Fisher Mountain Bikes, while Tom Ritchey started his own frame shop.\n\nThe first mountain bikes were basically road bicycle frames (with heavier tubing and different geometry) with a wider frame and fork to allow for a wider tire. The handlebars were also different in that they were a straight, transverse-mounted handlebar, rather than the dropped, curved handlebars that are typically installed on road racing bicycles. Also, some of the parts on early production mountain bicycles were taken from the BMX bicycle. Other contributors were Otis Guy and Keith Bontrager.\n\nTom Ritchey built the first regularly available mountain bike frame, which was accessorized by Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly and sold by their company called MountainBikes (later changed to Fisher Mountain Bikes, then bought by Trek, still under the name Gary Fisher, currently sold as Trek's \"Gary Fisher Collection\"). The first two mass-produced mountain bikes were sold in the early 1980s: the Specialized Stumpjumper and Univega Alpina Pro. In 1988, The Great Mountain Biking Video was released, soon followed by others. In 2007, Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bikes was released, documenting mountain bike history during the formative period in Northern California. Additionally, a group of mountain bikers called the Laguna Rads formed a club during the mid eighties and began a weekly ride, exploring the uncharted coastal hillsides of Laguna Beach, California. Industry insiders suggest that this was the birth of the freeride movement, as they were cycling up and down hills and mountains where no cycling specific trail network prexisted. The Laguna Rads have also held the longest running downhill race once a year since 1986.\n\nAt the time, the bicycle industry was not impressed with the mountain bike, regarding mountain biking to be short-term fad. In particular, large manufacturers such as Schwinn and Fuji failed to see the significance of an all-terrain bicycle and the coming boom in 'adventure sports'. Instead, the first mass-produced mountain bikes were pioneered by new companies such as MountainBikes (later, Fisher Mountain Bikes), Ritchey, and Specialized. Specialized was an American startup company that arranged for production of mountain bike frames from factories in Japan and Taiwan. First marketed in 1981, Specialized's mountain bike largely followed Tom Ritchey's frame geometry, but used TiG welding to join the frame tubes instead of fillet-brazing, a process better suited to mass production, and which helped to reduce labor and manufacturing cost. The bikes were configured with 15 gears using derailleurs, a triple chainring, and a cogset with five sprockets.", "output": ["Mountain biking as a sport came into existence in various areas in the USA in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Use strong and unique passwords: Create complex passwords that include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using common words or personal information. Additionally, use a different password for each online account to prevent multiple accounts from being compromised if one password is breached.\n\n2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. Enable 2FA whenever possible, especially for important accounts like email and banking.\n\n3. Keep your software up to date: Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software applications on your devices. These updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.\n\n4. Be cautious of phishing attempts: Be wary of unsolicited emails, messages, or phone calls asking for personal information or urging you to click on suspicious links. Avoid providing sensitive information unless you are certain of the legitimacy of the request.\n\n5. Use a reliable antivirus and antimalware software: Install reputable security software on your devices and keep it updated. This can help detect and remove malware that could compromise your security.\n\n6. Be mindful of public Wi-Fi networks: Avoid accessing sensitive information or logging into accounts when connected to public Wi-Fi networks. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and protect your data.\n\n7. Regularly back up your data: Create regular backups of your important files and store them securely. In case of a hack or data loss, having backups will help you recover your information.\n\n8. Be cautious of downloads and attachments: Only download files or open attachments from trusted sources. Malicious software can be disguised as innocent-looking files, so exercise caution.\n\n9. Limit personal information shared online: Be mindful of the personal information you share on social media and other online platforms. The more information available, the easier it is for hackers to target you.\n\n10. Educate yourself about online security: Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices for protecting yourself online. Regularly educate yourself on common hacking techniques and ways to stay safe.\n\nRemember, staying vigilant and proactive is key to protecting yourself from hackers.", "There are multiple ways to be vigilant and protect your digital identity and presence in the Internet. First turn on MFA (Multiple Factor Authentication) everywhere for all your accounts work (must be turned on if your employer takes security seriously) and personal accounts.

The prose works are divided into The Discourses, The Letters, and the Seven Sermons.\n\nPoetic works\n\nMa\u1e6dnaw\u012bye Ma'naw\u012b, Mevl\u00e2na Museum, Konya, Turkey\nRumi's best-known work is the Ma\u1e6dnaw\u012bye Ma'naw\u012b (Spiritual Couplets; \u0645\u062b\u0646\u0648\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0648\u06cc). The six-volume poem holds a distinguished place within the rich tradition of Persian Sufi literature, and has been commonly called \"the Quran in Persian\". Many commentators have regarded it as the greatest mystical poem in world literature. It contains approximately 27,000 lines, each consisting of a couplet with an internal rhyme. While the mathnawi genre of poetry may use a variety of different metres, after Rumi composed his poem, the metre he used became the mathnawi metre par excellence. The first recorded use of this metre for a mathnawi poem took place at the Nizari Ismaili fortress of Girdkuh between 1131\u20131139. It likely set the stage for later poetry in this style by mystics such as Attar and Rumi.\nRumi's other major work is the D\u012bw\u0101n-e Kab\u012br (Great Work) or D\u012bw\u0101n-e Shams-e Tabr\u012bz\u012b (The Works of Shams of Tabriz; \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0645\u0633 \u062a\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0632\u06cc), named in honour of Rumi's master Shams. Besides approximately 35000 Persian couplets and 2000 Persian quatrains, the Divan contains 90 Ghazals and 19 quatrains in Arabic, a couple of dozen or so couplets in Turkish (mainly macaronic poems of mixed Persian and Turkish) and 14 couplets in Greek (all of them in three macaronic poems of Greek-Persian).\nProse works\nFihi Ma Fihi (In It What's in It, Persian: \u0641\u06cc\u0647 \u0645\u0627 \u0641\u06cc\u0647) provides a record of seventy-one talks and lectures given by Rumi on various occasions to his disciples. It was compiled from the notes of his various disciples, so Rumi did not author the work directly. An English translation from the Persian was first published by A.J. Arberry as Discourses of Rumi (New York: Samuel Weiser, 1972), and a translation of the second book by Wheeler Thackston, Sign of the Unseen (Putney, VT: Threshold Books, 1994).

The sermons themselves give a commentary on the deeper meaning of Qur'an and Hadith. The sermons also include quotations from poems of Sana'i, 'Attar, and other poets, including Rumi himself. As Aflak\u012b relates, after Shams-e Tabr\u012bz\u012b, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Sal\u0101h al-D\u012bn Zark\u016bb.

Scalability: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, they face scalability issues. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum have limitations on the number of transactions they can process per second, which can lead to slower transaction times and higher fees during peak periods.\n\n5. User adoption: Despite the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, widespread adoption is still a challenge. Many people are unfamiliar with the technology and may find it difficult to use or understand. Additionally, the lack of user-friendly interfaces and limited merchant acceptance can hinder adoption.\n\n6. Energy consumption: Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, require significant amounts of energy for mining and transaction processing. This high energy consumption has raised concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of cryptocurrencies.\n\n7. Lack of privacy: While cryptocurrencies offer pseudonymity, they are not entirely private. Blockchain transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making it possible to trace and link transactions to individuals. This lack of complete privacy can be a challenge for users who value anonymity.\n\n8. Interoperability: The lack of interoperability between different blockchain networks can pose challenges for seamless transfer of assets and data across platforms. Efforts are being made to address this issue, but it remains a challenge for widespread adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt's important to note that while these challenges exist, the cryptocurrency industry is continuously evolving, and efforts are being made to address them through technological advancements and regulatory developments.", "1) Crypto is an invention that has yet to find a real life purpose.

It is an important branch in biology because heredity is vital to organisms' evolution. Gregor Mendel, a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\n\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded to study the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including molecular genetics, epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may increase or decrease gene transcription. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.", "Genetics is the branch of biology that studies how traits are passed from parents to offspring. It involves the study of genes, which are segments of DNA that contain instructions for building and maintaining an organism.

In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs and neighboring Krivichi, who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the West Dvina, Dnieper and Volga rivers. To their north, in the Ladoga and Karelia regions, were the Finnic Chud tribe. In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the Poliane, a group of Slavicized tribes with Iranian origins, the Drevliane to the west of the Dnieper, and the Severiane to the east. To their north and east were the Vyatichi, and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppe lands populated by nomadic herdsmen.\n\nThere was once controversy over whether the Rus' were Varangians or Slavs, however, more recently scholarly attention has focused more on debating how quickly an ancestrally Norse people assimilated into Slavic culture. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, and legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent, the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. This often unfruitful debate over origins has periodically devolved into competing nationalist narratives of dubious scholarly value being promoted directly by various government bodies, in a number of states. This was seen in the Stalinist period, when Soviet historiography sought to distance the Rus' from any connection to Germanic tribes, in an effort to dispel Nazi propaganda claiming the Russian state owed its existence and origins to the supposedly racially superior Norse tribes. More recently, in the context of resurgent nationalism in post-Soviet states, Anglophone scholarship has analyzed renewed efforts to use this debate to create ethno-nationalist foundation stories, with governments sometimes directly involved in the project. Conferences and publications questioning the Norse origins of the Rus' have been supported directly by state policy in some cases, and the resultant foundation myths have been included in some school textbooks in Russia.\n\nWhile Varangians were Norse traders and Vikings, some Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs (see Anti-Normanism). Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Primary Chronicle, which was produced in the 12th century. Nationalist accounts on the other hand have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names.\n\nNevertheless, the close connection between the Rus' and the Norse is confirmed both by extensive Scandinavian settlements in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine and by Slavic influences in the Swedish language.Though the debate over the origin of the Rus' remains politically charged, there is broad agreement that if the proto-Rus' were indeed originally Norse, they were quickly nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices. This position, roughly representing a scholarly consensus (at least outside of nationalist historiography), was summarized by the historian, F. Donald Logan, \"in 839, the Rus were Swedes; in 1043 the Rus were Slavs\". Recent scholarship has attempted to move past the narrow and politicized debate on origins, to focus on how and why assimilation took place so quickly. Some modern DNA testing also points to Viking origins, not only of some of the early Rus' princely family and/or their retinues but also links to possible brethren from neighboring countries like Sviatopolk I of Kiev.\n\nAhmad ibn Fadlan, an Arab traveler during the 10th century, provided one of the earliest written descriptions of the Rus': \"They are as tall as a date palm, blond and ruddy, so that they do not need to wear a tunic nor a cloak; rather the men among them wear garments that only cover half of his body and leaves one of his hands free.\" Liutprand of Cremona, who was twice an envoy to the Byzantine court (949 and 968), identifies the \"Russi\" with the Norse (\"the Russi, whom we call Norsemen by another name\") but explains the name as a Greek term referring to their physical traits (\"A certain people made up of a part of the Norse, whom the Greeks call [...] the Russi on account of their physical features, we designate as Norsemen because of the location of their origin.\"). Leo the Deacon, a 10th-century Byzantine historian and chronicler, refers to the Rus' as \"Scythians\" and notes that they tended to adopt Greek rituals and customs. But 'Scythians' in Greek parlance is used predominantly as a generic term for nomads.", "output": ["The name \"Kievan Rus'\" originated in the 9th century when the region north of the Black Sea, which is now Ukraine and Belarus, was primarily inhabited by eastern Slavic tribes.

Growing up, Sarah always dreamt of making a difference in the world, but she felt limited by the constraints of her surroundings. She yearned for something more, an opportunity to explore her passions and unleash her full potential.\n\nWith a heart full of hope and courage, Sarah made the bold decision to move to America. She saw it as a land of endless possibilities, where dreams could become a reality. Little did she know that this decision would be the catalyst for her journey to self-actualization.\n\nUpon her arrival, Sarah was immediately struck by the diversity and vibrancy of American culture. She was exposed to a melting pot of ideas, beliefs, and perspectives, which broadened her horizons and challenged her preconceived notions. This exposure helped her understand the importance of embracing diversity and celebrating individuality.\n\nSarah's journey to self-actualization began with education. She enrolled in a university, eager to expand her knowledge and develop her skills. The academic environment provided her with a platform to explore various disciplines and discover her true passions. She engaged in thought-provoking discussions, collaborated with like-minded individuals, and learned from esteemed professors who nurtured her intellectual growth.\n\nOutside of the classroom, Sarah immersed herself in the community, volunteering her time and energy to causes close to her heart. This allowed her to connect with people from different walks of life, understand their struggles, and contribute to positive change. Through these experiences, Sarah learned the power of empathy, compassion, and the importance of giving back.\n\nAs Sarah continued her journey, she encountered setbacks and obstacles along the way.

She learned to embrace failure, understanding that it was an essential part of the journey towards self-actualization.\n\nThroughout her time in America, Sarah also discovered the significance of self-care and personal well-being. She recognized that taking care of her mental, emotional, and physical health was crucial for her overall growth and happiness. She prioritized self-reflection, practiced mindfulness, and surrounded herself with a supportive network of friends and mentors who encouraged her to be her authentic self.\n\nAs the years passed, Sarah's journey to self-actualization began to bear fruit. She found her true calling in advocating for social justice and equality. Through her work, she was able to amplify the voices of the marginalized and create meaningful change.

It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.", "output": ["Yellowstone National Park is known for its diverse environments, which include:\n\n1.

Harvesting: Grapes are harvested when they reach the desired level of ripeness. This can vary depending on the type of wine being produced.\n\n3. Crushing and Pressing: The harvested grapes are crushed to release the juice. For white wine production, the grapes are typically pressed to separate the juice from the skins and seeds. In red wine production, the crushed grapes are fermented with their skins to extract color, tannins, and flavor compounds.\n\n4. Fermentation: The juice, or must, undergoes fermentation, where yeast converts the sugars in the juice into alcohol. Fermentation can take place in stainless steel tanks, oak barrels, or other containers. The temperature and duration of fermentation depend on the desired style of wine.\n\n5. Aging and Maturation: After fermentation, the wine is aged to develop its flavors and aromas. This can be done in stainless steel tanks, oak barrels, or a combination of both. Aging can range from a few months to several years, depending on the type of wine.\n\n6. Clarification and Filtration: To remove any sediment or impurities, the wine is clarified and filtered. This helps improve its clarity and stability.\n\n7. Bottling: Once the winemaker is satisfied with the wine's quality, it is bottled. The wine may undergo further aging in the bottle before it is released for sale.\n\nIt's important to note that winemaking techniques can vary depending on the winemaker's preferences, the type of wine being produced, and regional traditions. The process described above provides a general overview of winemaking.", "Winemaking is the process of using fruit for fermentation into alcohol. The science of winemaking is called enology. There are two general types of wine production: still wine and sparkling wine. The three categories of wine are red, white, and rose. Most wine is made from grapes but others can include apples, pears, and honey."]}, {"instruction": "Can you name five of the most successful professional golfers in history?", "input": "", "output": ["Certainly!

You can easily get a direct flight from Europe to Las Vegas in the States. That makes an easy start for your trip. As you start in Las Vegas take some time to adjust and adapt to the scenery. There are a lot of things to do and see in Las Vegas itself. For example, take a walk along the strip to see all the hotels and casinos, even get inside of one - the Caesars Palace or the Venetian are very interesting. Also there are a lot of show offerings such as Cirque du Soleil or parties in the evening, if you want to have good seats it's best to book your tickets in advance before you start your trip. As you strolled through the city of Las Vegas for two days, on the third day it's time to pick up your rental car. With your rental car begins your road trip through the wide streets of the United states. The first goal for your trip will be Zion Nationalpark in Utah, about a 3 hours drive from Las Vegas. In this national park you have the chance to hike and wander around beautiful nature. One of the most impressive hikes is called Angels Landing. At the highest point of this hike you have a beautiful overview of the whole national park. But be aware that it is necessary to book your ticket for this trail way in advance or if you want to do it on short notice you have to have luck in the lottery. Otherwise you are not allowed to hike this trail. That restriction is necessary because too many people hiked the trail and it became dangerous, so numbers of hikers had to be limited a day. If you spend two day exploring the landscape of Zion Nationalpark it's time to move on to the next location, which is Bryce Canyon National Park also in Utah. It takes around two to 3 hours to drive there from Zion. The area right before the Nationalpark is small with some restaurants, hotels, motels or campgrounds. The Canyon itself is huge and will give you a lot of opportunity to explore. In the wintertime it can be very cold and snowy, therefore bring warm clothes. In the two days you spend there you can visit beautiful overviews on the edge of the canyon and also hike down and explore the deeper canyon. One of the highlights is the amphitheater or Thors' hammer. It is also recommended to watch the sun rise over Bryce Canyon because it's more spectacular from the colors than the sunset in the evening. From Bryce Canyon Nationalpark the road trip continues to the city of Page in Arizona from where you can visit the Antelope Canyon. Take at least one full day there to discover either the upper or the lower Antelope Canyon. But be aware, you have to book tickets in advance! If you don't get a ticket for them there is also Antelope Canyon X, which is a real alternative to visit and maybe even less crowded then the other ones. From this point of the tour you then drive to Grand Canyon National Park, which will take about 3 hours at least. This is probably the highlight of the National Parks in this area of the United States. Recommended is to stay at least for two days, even better if you have more time. You should take one trail down the canyon if you are in the physical state to do this. One most common way down is the south Kalib trail which has a beautiful viewpoint called Ooh Aah Point. If you want to watch the sunset in the evening the desert view watchpoint is a great way to do so. Also take some time to stroll around at Grand Canyon Village, there are some nice souvenir shops and more. From Grand Canyon National Park the road trip then moves on to the last target location, which is Los Angeles in California. It's a longer drive there and takes around 8 hours to drive there. But once you arrive there you will have some nice, relaxing days before your flight back home to Frankfurt. You can spend one day visiting Santa Monica, the beach and the Pier there. It's nice to rent a bicycle out there and ride along the beach side through Venice Beach up to Hermosa beach or even further if you like. Another activity could be to visit Dolby Theatre and the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, there are a lot of shops out there or you can just stroll along. But one thing to be aware of when visiting Los Angeles with a car is that there is always traffic and you can be stuck in traffic many times. As Los Angeles is the last stop on the proposed US-trip on your last day it is time to bring back your rental car right before you fly back, just bring it to the rental car stores at the LAX airport. From this airport you will board your flight back to Europe or somewhere else.", "A 14-day trip through the United States can be an exciting adventure!

Natural hydrogen may be renewable, non-polluting and allows for lower cost operation compared to industrial hydrogen. Natural hydrogen has been identified in many source rocks in areas beyond the sedimentary basins where oil companies typically operate.\n\nOrigin of natural hydrogen\nThere are several sources of natural hydrogen:\n\n- degassing of deep hydrogen from the Earth's crust and mantle;\n- reaction of water with ultrabasic rocks (serpentinisation);\n- contact of water with reducing agents in the Earth's mantle;\n- interaction of water with freshly exposed rock surfaces (weathering);\n- decomposition of hydroxyl ions in the structure of minerals;\n- Natural radiolysis of water;\n- decomposition of organic matter;\n- biological activity\n- Extraction\n- Natural hydrogen is extracted from wells, mixed with other gases such as nitrogen or helium.\n\nSeveral sources have been identified in France. Geologists Alain Prinzhofer and Eric Derville have demonstrated the existence of large reservoirs in a dozen countries, including Mali and the United States. However, their potential remains difficult to assess.\n\nNumerous emanations on the ocean floor have been identified but are difficult to exploit.

Enhanced Security: MFA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring multiple forms of verification.

This makes it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access to your accounts, even if they manage to obtain your password.\n\n2. Protection against Password Theft: Passwords can be easily compromised through various means such as phishing attacks, keyloggers, or data breaches. MFA provides an additional safeguard, making it much more difficult for attackers to gain access to your accounts, even if they have your password.\n\n3. Mitigation of Credential Stuffing Attacks: Credential stuffing is a technique where attackers use stolen username and password combinations from one site to gain unauthorized access to other sites. By implementing MFA, even if your credentials are compromised, the attacker would still need the additional factor to gain access, making it much harder for them to succeed.\n\n4.

While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, many people wonder if it is better to buy a used car compared to a new car. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of buying a used car and help you decide if it is the right choice for you.\n\nPros of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Lower Price\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of buying a used car is the lower price. Used cars are typically much cheaper than new cars, even if they are only a few years old. This is because new cars lose value quickly as soon as they are driven off the dealership lot. By buying a used car, you can often get a great deal and save thousands of dollars.\n\n2. Lower Depreciation\n\nNew cars depreciate quickly in the first few years of ownership, often losing up to 50% of their value. Used cars, on the other hand, have already gone through this initial depreciation period, so they lose value at a much slower rate. This means that if you decide to sell your used car in a few years, you may not lose as much money as you would with a new car.\n\n3. Lower Insurance Costs\n\nInsurance costs for a used car are typically lower than for a new car. This is because used cars are less expensive, so the insurance company does not have to pay out as much if the car is damaged or totaled. Additionally, if you own the car outright, you may be able to choose a lower level of insurance coverage, which can further reduce your insurance costs.\n\n4. More Options\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you have a wider range of options to choose from than if you were buying a new car. You can choose from different makes, models, and years, and you may be able to find a car with features that are no longer available on new cars. This means that you can find a car that fits your specific needs and preferences.\n\n5. No Hidden Fees\n\nWhen you buy a new car, you may be charged various fees and expenses, such as a destination fee, dealer preparation fee, and advertising fee. With a used car, you do not have to worry about these hidden fees, as they have already been paid by the previous owner.\n\nCons of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Higher Maintenance Costs\n\nUsed cars may require more maintenance and repairs than new cars, especially if they are older or have high mileage. This can result in higher maintenance costs, which can offset some of the savings you get from buying a used car.\n\n2. Higher Interest Rates\n\nIf you are financing a used car, you may have to pay a higher interest rate than if you were financing a new car. This is because lenders consider used cars to be a greater risk, as they are more likely to need repairs and maintenance.\n\n3. Limited Warranty\n\nMany used cars do not come with a warranty, or the warranty may have expired. This means that if something goes wrong with the car, you will have to pay for the repairs out of pocket. Some dealerships offer extended warranties for used cars, but these can be expensive.\n\n4. Unknown History\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you may not know the full history of the vehicle. The previous owner may not have disclosed all accidents or repairs, and there may be hidden issues that only become apparent after you have purchased the car.\n\n5. Less Advanced Features\n\nUsed cars may not have the latest technology and safety features that are available on new cars. This can be a disadvantage if you are looking for a car with advanced features, such as a backup camera or lane departure warning.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying a used car can be a great option for many people, as it offers a lower price, slower depreciation, lower insurance costs, more options, and no hidden fees. However, there are also some disadvantages to buying a used car, such as higher maintenance costs, limited warranty, unknown history, higher interest rates, and less advanced features. Ultimately, the decision to buy a used car or a new car depends on your personal preferences and budget.", "The decision to buy a used car or a new car depends on several factors, such as personal preferences, budget, and individual circumstances. \n\nBuying a used car can often be more affordable, as used cars generally have a lower purchase price and lower depreciation rates compared to new cars. Additionally, used cars may have already gone through the initial depreciation period, so you may experience less of a loss in value if you decide to sell it in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, new cars typically come with the latest features, technology advancements, and warranties, giving you a sense of reliability and peace of mind. New cars also provide the opportunity to customize and personalize the vehicle according to your preferences.\n\nUltimately, the choice between buying a used car or a new car will depend on your budget, preferences, and what you prioritize in a vehicle. It can be helpful to consider factors such as your financial situation, desired features, maintenance costs, and the overall condition of the used car before making a decision."]}, {"instruction": "What is the difference between bills, notes, and bonds?", "input": "", "output": ["Bills, notes, and bonds are all types of debt securities issued by the government or corporations to raise capital.

Although there have been many different swing styles over the years, there are fundamentals to playing the game that when followed, have produced the most successful golfers. \n\nBuilding a strong golf foundation using 4 key principles is key to improving at the game of golf which are: aligning your expectations to reality, applying an effective on course strategy, practicing correctly, and, building a sharp mental game.\n\nBy aligning your expectations to the reality of how you are playing, you allow your mind to accept the good with the bad which allows for a more free and easy playing style, often leading to better play.\n\nApplying an effective course strategy will allow you to score better as you know where you can make up strokes on your competitors.  For example, driving distance off the tee paired with greens in regulation play a crucial role in scoring, as opposed to putting whereas you have a 20 foot putt compared to a 40 foot putt, your make percentages are both low.\n\nLearning how to practice correctly can also improve your on course scoring as most approach practice incorrectly.  Zombie range sessions have become the norm, but rarely in golf do you have the same shot twice in a row.  Implement that same theory on the driving range so you have more of a feel of what on course play will feel like.\n\nFinally, in order to improve your scoring, you need to build a sharp mental game while you play.  This includes visualizing your shot before you hit it, being able to clear your head of all unwanted thoughts other than the shot you want to hit, and implementing a pre shot routine that is easily replicable.\n\nBy applying these core 4 strategies, you should see your golf scores decrease without any significant change in your actual swing."]}, {"instruction": "Can I provide commercial software or services based on Spark?", "input": "", "output": ["Yes, you can provide commercial software or services based on Spark.

The letter explained that the treasure was not material wealth but the journey of self-discovery that John had embarked upon. It was a reminder that the true treasures in life are often found within ourselves.\n\nJohn's heart filled with gratitude and a newfound appreciation for the hidden room.

From that day forward, John shared his discovery with others, inviting them to explore the hidden room and discover the treasures within themselves.\n\nAnd so, the hidden room became a gathering place for friends and strangers alike.

It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815.\n\nTensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.\nAt sea, the far larger Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 to 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada. This was balanced by the US winning control of the Northwest Territory with victories at Lake Erie and the Thames in 1813. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.\n\nIn August 1814, British troops burned Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. Fighting continued in the Southeastern United States, where in late 1813 a civil war had broken out between a Creek faction supported by Spanish and British traders and those backed by the U.S. Supported by U.S. militia under General Andrew Jackson, the U.S.-backed Creeks won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Pensacola in November 1814. In early 1815, Jackson defeated a British attack on New Orleans, catapulting him to national celebrity and later victory in the 1828 United States presidential election. News of this success arrived in Washington at the same time as that of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing before the war. While Britain insisted this included lands belonging to their Native American allies prior to 1811, as Congress did not recognize them as independent nations, the Americans did not comply with these provisions and the British made no effort to compel them to do so. The Native Americans were subsequently pushed west of the Mississippi River.", "The War of 1812 was a conflict between the United States and the United Kingdom, along with its allies in British North America. It took place from June 1812 to February 1815. The war was primarily caused by disagreements over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. The war had limited participation by Spain in Florida."]}, {"instruction": "What is the special aspect of Einstein's special theory of relativity?", "input": "Until several years later when Einstein developed general relativity, which introduced a curved spacetime to incorporate gravity, the phrase \"special relativity\" was not used.

By drilling multiple wells from a single location, companies can tap into multiple reservoirs and maximize their output. This can also reduce the environmental impact by minimizing the number of drilling sites required.\n\nAdditionally, directional drilling can help mitigate drilling risks. For example, it can be used to avoid drilling through sensitive areas such as protected wildlife habitats or underground water sources. It can also help navigate around geological challenges, such as faults or unstable formations, reducing the likelihood of accidents or wellbore instability.\n\nOverall, directional drilling offers oil and gas exploration companies greater flexibility, increased production potential, and improved safety in their drilling operations.", "There are several reasons and oil and gas exploration company would need to utilize directional drilling techniques when drilling wells. If, for any reason, a drill site is not accessible from the surface (ground level) then the drilling rig will be offset from the target.

Spontaneous fission was discovered in 1940 by Flyorov, Petrzhak, and Kurchatov in Moscow, in an experiment intended to confirm that, without bombardment by neutrons, the fission rate of uranium was negligible, as predicted by Niels Bohr; it was not negligible.\n\nThe unpredictable composition of the products (which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner) distinguishes fission from purely quantum tunneling processes such as proton emission, alpha decay, and cluster decay, which give the same products each time. Nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons. Both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart. This makes a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction possible, releasing energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid, uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe amount of free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as gasoline, making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy. The products of nuclear fission, however, are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant amounts of time, giving rise to a nuclear waste problem. However, the seven long-lived fission products make up only a small fraction of fission products. Neutron absorption which does not lead to fission produces Plutonium (from 238\nU) and minor actinides (from both 235\nU and 238\nU) whose radiotoxicity is far higher than that of the long lived fission products. Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and the destructive potential of nuclear weapons are a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use fission as an energy source. The thorium fuel cycle produces virtually no plutonium and much less minor actinides, but 232\nU - or rather its decay products - are a major gamma ray emitter. All actinides are fertile or fissile and fast breeder reactors can fission them all albeit only in certain configurations. Nuclear reprocessing aims to recover usable material from spent nuclear fuel to both enable uranium (and thorium) supplies to last longer and to reduce the amount of \"waste\". The industry term for a process that fissions all or nearly all actinides is a \"closed fuel cycle\".", "output": ["Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where particles can pass through potential barriers even though they do not have enough energy to overcome them classically.

This process occurs through quantum tunneling, as the proton tunnels through the potential barrier of the nuclear forces.\n\n2. Alpha Decay: Alpha decay is another form of radioactive decay where an alpha particle (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) is emitted from the nucleus of an atom.

Cluster Decay: Cluster decay is a type of radioactive decay where a larger cluster of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is emitted from the nucleus of an atom. Similar to proton emission and alpha decay, cluster decay occurs through quantum tunneling.\n\nThese examples of quantum tunneling processes occur spontaneously and have predictable compositions in terms of the particles emitted.

After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly-established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly-established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined, Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s. Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001, were landmark moments of his era. China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later.

He also wrote in and translated from English and French.\n\nPessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others, of which three stand out, Alberto Caeiro, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, and Ricardo Reis. He did not call them pseudonyms because he felt that this did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.\n\nPessoa's earliest heteronym, at the age of six, was Chevalier de Pas. Other childhood heteronyms included Dr. Pancr\u00e1cio and David Merrick, followed by Charles Robert Anon, a young Englishman who became Pessoa's alter ego. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the University of Lisbon, Alexander Search took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search was English, he was born in Lisbon, as was his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another alter ego, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, supposedly a Portuguese naval and mechanical engineer, who was born in Tavira, hometown of Pessoa's ancestors, and graduated in Glasgow. Translator and literary critic Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.

It\u2019s in our windows, on our screens, in our cabinets, and in many of the devices we interact with every day. Even though glass can be found everywhere, you may live your whole life not knowing much about how it\u2019s made or what it\u2019s composed of. Even if you think you know the basics, you\u2019ve only skimmed the surface.   \n\nAt a high level, glass is sand that\u2019s been melted down and chemically transformed. If you\u2019ve ever been to the beach, you know exactly how hot sand can get while remaining in its solid form. The kind of heat necessary to transform sand into a liquid state (eventually becoming glass) is much hotter than any sunny day. To make sand melt, you need to heat it to roughly 1700\u00b0C (3090\u00b0F), which is approximately the same temperature a space shuttle reaches as it re-enters earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe sand commonly used to make glass is comprised of small grains of quartz crystals, made up of molecules of silicon dioxide, which is also known as silica. When those molecules are heated to high enough temperatures, the sand melts and loses its crystalline structure, and as it cools it gains an entirely different structure. That structure, on a molecular level, is somewhere in between a liquid and a solid. This in-between state is known as an amorphous solid, which means it has some of the crystalline structure of a solid coupled with the molecular randomness of a liquid.\n\nGlass Melting\nDepending on the sand mixture, glass can have a variety of properties. Certain elements or chemicals mixed with sand can change glass\u2019s color, for example. Glass\u2019s properties can also change based on how it\u2019s manufactured and the processes by which it\u2019s shaped afterward. To strengthen glass, manufacturers can use thermal tempering to heat and cool it rapidly. Glass can also be strengthened chemically through an ion exchange process that makes the surface of the glass tougher.\n\nThe glass most people are familiar with is soda-lime glass, which is a combination of soda (also known as soda ash or washing soda), limestone, and sand. Although you can make glass simply by heating and then rapidly cooling silica, the manufacturing of soda-lime glass is a little more complex. By adding soda (sodium carbonate), the melting point of the sand is reduced so it can be transformed into glass at lower temperatures and save energy during manufacturing. However, adding soda to the mixture reduces its chemical durability, making it prone to dissolve when in contact with liquids. For most applications, that\u2019s not desirable, so limestone (calcium carbonate) is also added to the mixture, which acts as a stabilizer. Once the mixture of silica, soda, and limestone is heated, it can be cooled and molded for a variety of applications. \nAt Corning, we know glass. We know how to strengthen it through chemical processes like ion exchange, and we know how to bend it to make optical fiber that can stretch over vast distances. Our knowledge of glass goes back more than a century, allowing us to remain on the cutting edge of research and development. From simple soda-lime to complex glass structures that enable augmented reality, glass is an adaptable, wide-ranging material. That\u2019s why, after more than 165 years, we\u2019re still making new discoveries.", "Glass is made primarily from silica, which is a compound found in sand. Other ingredients such as soda ash and limestone are added to the silica to lower the melting point and improve the stability and durability of the glass. Additional materials can also be added to give glass specific properties such as color or resistance to heat."]}, {"instruction": "What are some examples of diseconomies of scale?", "input": "In microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of time. A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control. This is just a partial description of the concept.\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of the organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis.\n\nThe economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.\n\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\n\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products.\n\nEconomies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. As noticed, among the others, by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) these economies are not economies of scale.", "output": ["Some examples of diseconomies of scale include:\n\n1.

Fights gum disease: Some toothpaste contains antibacterial agents that can help reduce the risk of gum disease by killing harmful bacteria in your mouth.\n\nRemember to choose a toothpaste that is approved by dental associations and suits your specific oral health needs. It's also important to brush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time for optimal oral health.", "Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.\n\nUsefulness\nToothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal.

The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail.", "Grain orientation plays a significant role in the dimensional movement of wood. Wood is an anisotropic material, meaning it has different properties in different directions. The grain refers to the arrangement of the wood fibers, which can be either parallel or perpendicular to the surface of the wood.\n\nWhen wood absorbs or loses moisture, it expands or contracts. This movement occurs primarily across the grain, meaning perpendicular to the direction of the wood fibers. The amount of movement is influenced by the grain orientation.\n\nWood expands and contracts more across the grain than along the grain. So, if the grain orientation is perpendicular to the surface, the wood will experience greater dimensional changes. Conversely, if the grain orientation is parallel to the surface, the dimensional movement will be minimal.\n\nIt's important to consider grain orientation when working with wood to prevent issues such as warping, splitting, or cracking. By understanding how grain orientation affects dimensional movement, you can make informed decisions when designing or constructing with wood."]}, {"instruction": "Why babies cry ?", "input": "", "output": ["Babies cry for various reasons, as it is their way of communicating their needs and feelings.

The primary purpose is to ensure the safety of all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists. By setting speed limits, authorities aim to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidents and promote a smoother flow of traffic.\n\nDriving at excessive speeds increases the risk of losing control of the vehicle, reduces the driver's ability to react to unexpected situations, and extends the stopping distance required to avoid a collision. Speed limits help to mitigate these risks and provide a consistent framework for drivers to follow.\n\nAdditionally, speed limits are often set based on the design and conditions of the road. Factors such as curves, intersections, pedestrian crossings, and residential areas influence the appropriate speed for a given road segment. By adhering to speed limits, drivers can better navigate these conditions and reduce the chances of accidents occurring.\n\nUltimately, speed limits serve as a vital tool in promoting road safety and ensuring the well-being of all road users.", "Governments create and enforce speed limits for humans driving vehicles on public roads in the interest of public safety. The speed limits generally depend on the type of road, including whether it is in a residential area or a freeway.

It allows us to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be immediately apparent in tabular data alone. This information can be used to make informed decisions and solve complex problems.\n\n2. Planning and Decision Making: GIS provides a platform for planning and decision making in various fields such as urban planning, transportation, environmental management, and emergency response. By visualizing data on maps, decision-makers can better understand the potential impacts and implications of their choices.\n\n3. Resource Management: GIS is useful for managing and monitoring natural resources such as forests, water bodies, and wildlife habitats. It helps in assessing the health of ecosystems, tracking changes over time, and making informed decisions for sustainable resource management.\n\n4. Infrastructure Management: GIS plays a crucial role in managing infrastructure, such as roads, utilities, and telecommunications networks. It enables efficient asset management, maintenance planning, and optimization of resources.\n\n5. Emergency Response and Public Safety: GIS is widely used in emergency response and public safety applications. It helps in identifying high-risk areas, analyzing the impact of hazards, and coordinating response efforts during emergencies or natural disasters.\n\n6.

GIS are used to fight crime, protect endangered species, reduce pollution, cope with natural disasters, treat epidemics, and improve public health; GIS are instrumental in addressing some of our most pressing societal problems.GIS tools in aggregate save billions of dollars annually in the delivery of goods and services. GIS regularly helps in the day-to-day management of many natural and man-made resources, including sewer, water,power, transportation networks, and package delivery. GIS are at the heart of one of the most important processes in U.S. democracy, decadal redrawing of U.S. congressional districts, and hence the distribution of tax dollars and other government resources.GIS are needed in part because human consumption has reached levels such that many resources, including air and land, replacing substantial limits on human action.The first 100,000 years of human existence caused scant impacts on the world's resources, but in the past 300 years humans have permanently altered most of the Earth's Surface. The atmosphere and oceans exhibit a decreasing ability to benignly absorb carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two of humanity's primary waste products. Silt chokes many rivers, and there are abundant examples of smoke, ozone, or other noxious pollutants substantially harming public health. By the end of the 20th century, most lands south of the boreal region had been farmed, grazed,cut, built over, drained, flooded, or otherwise altered by humans. GIS help us identify and address environmental problems by providing crucial information on where problems occur and who are affected by them. GIS helps us identify the source, location, and extent of adverse environmental impacts, and may help us devise practical plans for monitoring, managing, and mitigating environmental damage.Human impacts on the environment have spurred a strong societal push for the adoption of GIS. Conflicts in resource use,concerns about pollution, and precautions to protect public health have led to legislative mandates that explicitly or implicitly require the consideration of geography. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a good example. The ESA requires adequate protection of rare and threatened organisms. This entails mapping the available habitat and species range and migration patterns, relative to human land use. \nGIS use is mandated in other endeavors, including emergency services, flood protection, disaster assessment and management, and infrastructure development.Public organizations have also adopted GIS because it aids in governmental functions. For example, emergency service vehicles are regularly dispatched and route using GIS. E911 GIS matches the caller's address to the nearest emergency service station, a route is generated based on the streetnetwork and traffic, and emergency crews dispatched in a fraction of the pre-GIS times.Many businesses adopt GIS for increased efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. Retail businesses locate stores based on a number of spatially related factors. Where are the potential customers?What is the spatial distribution of competing businesses? Where are potential new store locations? What are traffic flows near current stores, and how easy is it to park near and access these stores? GIS are also used in hundreds of other business applications, toroute vehicles, guide advertising, design buildings, plan construction, and sell real estate.The societal push to adopt GIS has been complemented by a technological pull in the development and application of GIS. Thousands of lives and untold wealth have been lost because ship captains could not answer the simple question, \u201cWhere am I?\u201dRemarkable positioning technologies, generically known as Global Navigation SatelliteSystems (GNSS), are now indispensable tools in commerce, planning, and safety.The technological pull has developed on several fronts. Spatial analysis in particular has been helped by faster computers with more storage, and by the increased interconnectedness via mobile networks. Most real-world spatial problems were beyond the scope of all but the largest organization until the 1990s. GIS computing expenses are becoming an afterthought as costs decrease and performance increases at dizzying rates. Powerful field computers are lighter, faster,more capable, and less expensive, so spatial data display and analysis capabilities may always be at hand.In addition to the computing improvements and the development of GNSS, current \u201ccameras\u201d deliver amazingly detailed aerial and satellite images. Initially,advances in image collection and interpretation were spurred by World War II and then the Cold War because accurate maps were required, but unavailable.Turned toward peacetime endeavors, imaging technologies now help us map food and fodder, houses and highways, and most other natural and human-built objects. Images may be rapidly converted to accurate spatial information over broad areas. Many techniques have been developed for extracting information from image data, and also for ensuring this information faithfully represents the location, shape, and characteristics of features on the ground. Visible light,laser, thermal, and radar scanners are currently being developed to further increase the speed and accuracy with which we map our world. Thus, advances in these three key technologies \u2014 imaging, GNSS, and computing \u2014 have substantially aided the development of GIS."]}, {"instruction": "What is a bank run?", "input": "", "output": ["A bank run is a sudden and drastic event that occurs when all the depositors in a bank rush to withdraw their deposits at the same time or within a very short timeframe.

This cultural emphasis on a specific sport can create a competitive advantage even with a smaller population.\n\n2. Investment in infrastructure and training: Countries that invest heavily in sports infrastructure, coaching, and athlete development programs can develop a strong talent pool, regardless of population size. Adequate facilities, training programs, and resources can help nurture and produce elite athletes.\n\n3.

By specializing in certain sports, they can allocate their resources more efficiently and achieve success despite a smaller population.\n\nIt's important to note that these factors can vary from sport to sport and country to country. Success in sports is a complex interplay of various factors, and population size is just one of many factors that can influence a country's sporting performance.", "A country's success in a given sport at the international level will depend on a number of factors other than population alone. While a country's population is a good identifier for the total selection pool for high performing athletes to come from, it is one of many factors. A country's founding history, climate zone, and GDP are other notable factors in sport performance. \n\nA nations history plays factor as many sports are baked in centuries of tradition. For example, Cricket, which is believed to have originated in England is most popular in countries that were originally British Colonies. Long traditions such as this set specific sports into the culture of a nation, increasing the percentage of the athlete pool that it can pull from and can increase the level at which that nation is competitive. \n\nClimate zone can also influence the competitiveness of a country in given sports. Norway, fore example, earned the most olympic medals of any country in the 2022 olympic games with a total of 37 medals. In the summer games of 2020 (held in 2021), Norway ranked 20th overall with just 8 medals. Norways Climate and Topography have led winter sports to be extremely popular, and Norway has over time developed elite programs in cross country/nordic skiing, speed skating, curling, biathlon, and ski jumping. \n\nA nations wealth will also influence performance in sport at the international level. This occurs predominantly for two reasons. First is that more money enables larger budgets on equipment, coaching, player development, participation in international circuits, data insights, medical staff etc. that over time create a performance separation from those who can not afford these things. Second is access to sports, many sports are quite expensive some examples include snow sports, gymnastics, swimming, hockey, and polo.

With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia.

An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nAn electric field generally varies in space and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, so it follows that an electric field is a vector field.\nThe study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.", "output": ["The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday.

With young children, it's important to bring water and food to keep them happy throughout the day, also having a few toys is not a bad idea. In that case, having water bottles, snacks, and sand toys would all be useful. If you're at the beach all day, it's also likely you'll swim in ocean or lay in the sand, so having towels and sunscreen at the ready is incredibly useful. \n\nOn the other hand, there are a few items that seem unnecessary, or just not helpful for a day at the beach. Why would anyone ever require 20 shovels? A shovel by itself might be helpful, but 20 is way too many, and certainly not useful. Also, if one is at the beach, then boots are likely overkill and not useful, since most beach-goers tend to be barefoot or wear sandals. Lastly, the list contains two items which are impractical for any beach trip: a parachute and a grand piano. In my entire life, I've never seen a grand piano at the beach. They're beautiful instruments, but very heavy and would take a ton of effort to get on the beach, not to mention the possible damage to the piano. A parachute is also similarly impractical. The family trip is exclusively on the ground, so bringing an item that helps people jump from planes seems entirely impractical."]}, {"instruction": "List the states which are part of the western ghat", "input": "The Western Ghats extend from the Satpura Range in the north, stretching from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu.

Risk of injury: Running without shoes increases the risk of stepping on sharp objects, glass, or rough surfaces that can cause cuts, bruises, or puncture wounds.\n2. Lack of cushioning: Shoes provide cushioning and shock absorption, which can help reduce impact on joints and muscles. Running barefoot may lead to increased stress on these areas.\n3.

It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a fiasco (\"flask\"; pl. fiaschi). However, the fiasco is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. In the mid-late 19th century, Baron Bettino Ricasoli (later Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy) helped establish Sangiovese as the blend's dominant grape variety, creating the blueprint for today's Chianti wines.\n\nThe first definition of a wine area called Chianti was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of Gaiole, Castellina and Radda; the so-called Lega del Chianti and later Provincia del Chianti (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely redrawn and divided into seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and R\u00f9fina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were added to the newly defined Chianti Classico region added in Chianti to their names, for example Greve in Chianti, which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled Chianti Classico come from the largest sub-area of Chianti, which includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may display the black rooster (gallo nero) seal on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers. Other variants, with the exception of Rufina north-east of Florence and Montalbano south of Pistoia, originate in the named provinces: Siena for the Colli Senesi, Florence for the Colli Fiorentini, Arezzo for the Colli Aretini and Pisa for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed Montespertoli.\n\nDuring the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes. Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4\u20137) may be labelled as Riserva.

It teaches you the importance of perseverance and not giving up, even when faced with challenges or setbacks. Just like in life, skateboarding teaches you that success often comes from continuous effort and dedication.\n\n2. Resilience: Skateboarding involves taking risks and trying new things, which can lead to falls and failures. However, skaters learn to get back up, dust themselves off, and try again. This resilience is a crucial skill that can be applied to various aspects of life, such as overcoming obstacles, facing failures, and bouncing back from setbacks.\n\n3. Problem-solving: Skateboarding requires problem-solving skills as skaters analyze their surroundings, plan their routes, and navigate obstacles. This ability to think critically and find creative solutions can be transferred to real-life situations, helping individuals tackle challenges and find innovative ways to overcome difficulties.\n\n4. Self-confidence: Learning and mastering new skateboarding tricks can boost self-confidence. Through practice and perseverance, skaters gain a sense of achievement and belief in their abilities. This confidence can extend beyond skateboarding and positively impact other areas of life, such as academics, relationships, and personal goals.\n\n5. Mindfulness: Skateboarding often demands focus and presence in the moment. Skaters need to be aware of their surroundings, body movements, and balance. This mindfulness can translate into increased self-awareness and the ability to appreciate the present moment in other aspects of life.\n\n6. Community and support: Skateboarding is often associated with a strong sense of community. Skaters often form bonds, support each other, and share their knowledge and experiences. This sense of camaraderie teaches individuals the importance of building relationships, supporting others, and being part of a community.\n\nIn conclusion, skateboarding goes beyond being just a sport or hobby.

In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin. Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again. It is just like in life where one grows with their challenges and needs to get up again until the goals are achieved.

Bus fares are usually more affordable compared to the overall expenses of owning and operating a car.\n\n2. Reduced stress: Driving in traffic can be stressful, especially during rush hour. By taking the bus, you can avoid the hassles of navigating through congested roads, finding parking spots, and dealing with road rage. This can lead to a more relaxed and enjoyable commute.\n\n3. Environmental benefits: Buses are more environmentally friendly than individual cars. By opting for public transportation, you can reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to improving air quality. Buses are generally more fuel-efficient and emit fewer greenhouse gases per passenger than cars.\n\n4. Time for other activities: When you ride the bus, you can utilize your travel time for other activities. You can read a book, catch up on emails, listen to podcasts, or simply relax and enjoy the journey. This can help you make the most of your time and increase productivity.\n\n5. Health benefits: Walking to and from bus stops can provide a daily dose of physical activity, which is beneficial for your health. Additionally, studies have shown that people who use public transportation tend to have lower stress levels and a reduced risk of obesity compared to those who drive alone.\n\n6. Community connection: Riding the bus allows you to connect with your community. You can interact with fellow passengers, get to know your neighbors, and experience a sense of shared experience. This can contribute to a more inclusive and connected community.\n\nIt's important to note that the benefits of riding the bus may vary depending on your specific circumstances, such as the availability and reliability of public transportation in your area, your commute distance, and personal preferences.", "Riding the bus to work instead of driving a car to work reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

A common view is that the U.S. won the Cold War because its capitalist economic system, characterized by free markets and the recognition of private property rights, was able to outperform the USSR's centrally-planned economy. The United States could therefore afford to spend more on its military than the USSR and won the nuclear arms race, which contributed to the internal collapse of the Soviet economy and the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union into smaller, individual states with democratic elections. Additionally, though the USSR and the United States never officially engaged in direct military conflict with one another during the Cold War, various factions supported by the United States and its Western allies were able to successfully defeat Soviet-backed factions in proxy wars that took place all across the globe (with the notable exception of Vietnam). These defeats gradually limited the USSR's ability to project its power on the world stage, and helped the United States build and strengthen key alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finally, the United States carried out effective intelligence, counter-intelligence, disinformation and propaganda campaigns that undermined the faith the USSR's population had in its government and buttressed support for the U.S. government's efforts domestically.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket).

Allowing me to have a cat would provide me with the opportunity to have a furry companion without compromising my health. Cats are known to be hypoallergenic and produce fewer allergens compared to dogs, making them a suitable choice for individuals with allergies.\n\nIn terms of cleanliness, I am committed to keeping my living space tidy. I plan to invest in a robotic vacuum and mop, which will help me maintain a clean environment. These devices are specifically designed to handle pet hair and will ensure that any shedding from the cat is taken care of effectively.\n\nI have already found a potential pet at the local animal shelter. The cat is a two-year-old shelter cat who is housebroken and friendly. This means that the cat is already trained to use a litter box, making it convenient for me as there are no carpeted floors in Unit 2C and the bathroom is tiled, which is ideal for a litter box setup.\n\nI am open to having a conversation with you to discuss any concerns you may have regarding having a cat in the unit. I am more than willing to pay a pet deposit and additional monthly rent, as stated in our rental contract, to ensure that any potential damages or extra cleaning expenses are covered.\n\nHaving a cat as a pet would greatly enhance my quality of life and provide me with companionship during my time at home. I believe it would be a positive addition to our community, and I hope you will consider my request.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my letter, George. I look forward to discussing this further with you.\n\nSincerely,\nSteve", "Hello, George,\n\nThis is Steve in Unit 2C. I hope your day is going well. I have a request I would like to ask of you.\n\nAs you know, I live alone. I have been considering getting a pet for companionship, but after reviewing my rental contract, I noticed the only permitted animals are small dogs and animals that can be kept in a tank, like hamsters and fish.\n\nI am hoping you would reconsider these restrictions and allow me to have a cat. I am more than willing to resign a rental contract to include the requisite pet deposit and pet rent.\n\nI thought about a dog, since those animals are already in the contract, but I don't want a dog. Since I work long hours, it's not ideal to have a dog in my unit. My unit is small and could be claustrophobic for a dog who has a lot of energy. I also don't want to leave a dog alone because it may bark and disturb the other tenants in the building. Dogs also urinate and defecate in the shared yard around the property, which is gross, considering not everyone picks up after their dogs. Also, I am allergic to dogs, so this rules out dogs.\n\nI also considered a hamster or fish, but I am reluctant to have either of those, as well. Firstly, they do not offer the same cuddly companionship of a cat. If a hamster got loose, it could cause far more damage to a unit than a cat could -- the hamster could defecate in many areas, chew electrical wires, and chew through drywall. Fish pose a problem if the tank cracks or breaks, which would cause lots of water damage to the flooring.\n\nI recognize there are drawbacks to any pet, including cats, and I understand that some landlords are reluctant to permit cats, because there is an impression that cats may be more destructive, such as peeing in inappropriate places. However, I believe a cat is the least-destructive option of all. As my unit is not carpeted, I don't believe persistent urination stains will be an issue. Cats are easy to litter box train and I plan to put the litter box in the tiled bathroom where there is no opportunity for urine to get into the subfloor. Cats are less destructive than dogs, because they don't chew on things like furniture and doorways. Cats also are not nearly as loud as barking dogs. \n\nI have already looked into pets at the local animal shelter and found a possible new roommate, who is a friendly two-year-old cat and is housebroken and box-trained. This is an ideal pet, since I don't have to risk accidents with box-training a kitten, and it's unlikely the cat will be destructive if it's already housebroken.\n\nI believe a cat would be the ideal companion for me, given my work schedule and my preference for my ideal pet. I am happy to discuss my desire in person and further elaborate my plan on how I will continue to maintain a clean and tidy unit with a cat, such as purchasing an automatic robot vacuum and mop to ensure an extra clean space.\n\nPlease consider my request. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely,\nSteve"]}, {"instruction": "Which of the following are beach wear vs what one would wear on a cold winter trek?

By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics", "output": ["The goal of combining all the \"omes\" in multiomics is to analyze complex biological data and find novel associations between different biological entities.

The final image is viewed through an eyepiece at the back of the telescope. Refractor telescopes are known for providing sharp, high-contrast images and are often used for planetary observations.\n\nOn the other hand, a reflector telescope uses a curved mirror to gather and focus light. Light enters the front of the telescope and reflects off a curved mirror at the back of the telescope. The reflected light then passes through an eyepiece, allowing the viewer to see the final image. Reflectors are typically larger in size and are often used for deep-sky observations, such as galaxies and nebulae.\n\nBoth types of telescopes have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on personal preferences and the specific type of observations one wishes to make.", "A refractor telescope uses lenses to focus the light into an image where a reflector telescope uses mirrors. Reflector telescopes are generally better for visual viewing of brighter celestial objects like the moon or planets and can collect more light due to their larger apertures. Refractor telescopes provide better contrast and image quality but collect less light which makes them more suitable for astrophotography where exposure time can be adjusted to compensate."]}, {"instruction": "How often is The Australian Chess Championship held?", "input": "The Australian Chess Championship is a tournament organised by the Australian Chess Federation and held every two years.

A diverter, also known as an energy diverter or solar diverter, is a device that redirects excess electricity generated by your solar panels to another appliance or storage system, such as a battery. \n\nIf you have a solar panel system connected to the grid, any excess electricity generated can be fed back into the grid and credited to your account through a process called net metering. This means that when your solar panels generate more electricity than you are currently using, the excess power is sent to the grid and you receive credits for it.

This would allow you to redirect the excess solar power to your car's charging system instead of sending it back to the grid. This can be a more efficient and cost-effective way to charge your car if you have ample excess solar power available.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you need a diverter depends on your specific setup, preferences, and goals.

She started her search here, because she noticed a strange pattern in the surface movement: there was a small trail between thousands of bees on the wall behind the table top.\n\nMilly knows a lot about bees. That male bees don\u2019t have stingers. Females and males have different body types and shapes. Females have shorter antennae, males tend to be slimmer and smaller. Milly also knows that each hive has a single queen, and that the queen likes to walk quickly amongst her hive. As she walks, the workers all around her will part in front of her, leaving a small wake behind the queen. With this in mind, Millly scanned the wall, looking for her. \n\nAnd there she is. The queen bee stands out. She\u2019s larger in every way. The patterns on her wings are more clear. She moves where she pleases, and her workers are happy to clear a path in front of her. Milly reached out and picked her up. The buzzing in the garage got louder almost immediately. The bees near the wall, started to lift off and fly around quickly in front of Milly, who was once again holding a hand over her mouth and nose. Milly turned to face the door and began to retrace her steps back out of the garage. \n\nAs Milly took each step, more and more bees started to land on her closed hand holding the queen. Bees landed on her arm, on her shoulder, on neck, and slowly covered all of Milly\u2019s body. Milly made it to the door, and walked out. The Jackson\u2019s started yelling, \u201cMilly are you OK?!\u201d \u201cMilly??!!!!\u201d \u201cCall 9-1-1!!!\u201d Roscoe barked. Milly couldn\u2019t hear anything over the buzzing though. The weight of the bees was unexpectedly heavy. The bees were warm too, and she could feel a tinge of perspiration on her brow.\n\nMilly headed home. She didn\u2019t have any pets of her own, she didn\u2019t ask for much, but she was about to make a big ask. Milly still moved slowly, as her vision was still obscured given the movement in front, above, and below her eyes. She could sense the Jackson\u2019s kids rushing ahead of her, and shouting. Milly could feel the queen in her hand moving around, pushing at the edges between her fingers, trying to get through to her hive that was crawling all over Milly.\n\nAs she walked back across the lawn, she started to see people on the street watching her. She could see her house between blinks, and her mother and father walking towards her, with big grins on their faces. They walked right up to Milly, and spoke loudly to be heard over the buzzing. \u201cWhere are you going, my little beekeeper?\u201d Her dad\u2019s voice cut through the buzz. Milly just looked up at him, and over at her mom. She responded with her eyes, though blinking rapidly, those big green eyes conveyed a desire to her parents that they understood.\n\nThe two parents looked at each other and sighed, then looked back down at their daughter. \u201cSo, what are we supposed to do, get a nice box or jar for the queen?\u201d Milly nodded, and headed through the gate to their backyard. Milly\u2019s parents followed, along with her brother, and the Jackson\u2019s, though Roscoe stayed wearily at the back of the group. Milly\u2019s mother disappeared into their shed and emerged a few seconds later with a small box that had a lid with a very fine mesh. A temporary home for a queen.\n\nThe box was placed on the patio table and the group gathered around. Milly reached out and placed the queen in the box and stepped back. As she stepped away, the bees started to lift off of her, buzzing in the air, waiting to pick up the new signal of the queen\u2019s location. Then one by one, they found her, and rapidly flew towards the box, covering the table in seconds.\n\nMilly let out a deep breath and looked at her friends and family. She dropped the hand from over her mouth, and helped a few bees that were stuck in her hair find their way out. She had the biggest smile on her face, like only a happy 6 year old can have, and she asked, \u201cWho likes honey?\u201d", "Once upon a time, in a quiet little neighborhood, there lived a brave and curious little girl named Emily. Emily loved spending her days exploring the world around her, and she had a special fondness for all creatures, big and small.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as Emily was playing in her backyard, she noticed a commotion coming from her neighbor's house. Curiosity piqued, she went closer to investigate. To her surprise, she discovered that her neighbors were dealing with a massive bee infestation. The air was filled with the buzzing of bees, and everyone seemed panicked.\n\nEmily's heart went out to her neighbors, and she knew she had to do something to help. She quickly ran back to her house and grabbed her notebook. She had read about bees before and remembered that they were essential for our ecosystem. She also knew that they could be safely relocated rather than exterminated.\n\nWith determination in her eyes, Emily approached her neighbors and shared her plan. She explained that instead of harming the bees, they could contact a local beekeeper who would be able to safely remove the swarm and relocate them to a more suitable location.\n\nHer neighbors were skeptical at first, but seeing the confidence and knowledge in Emily's eyes, they decided to give it a try. Together, they found a beekeeper who specialized in bee removal and conservation.\n\nThe beekeeper arrived promptly, wearing a protective suit, and assessed the situation. Emily watched with excitement as the beekeeper carefully collected the bees using a special box designed for transportation. The buzzing gradually subsided, and the air became calm once again.\n\nAs the last bee was safely collected, Emily's neighbors expressed their gratitude to her. They were amazed by her bravery and knowledge, realizing that she had not only saved their home from the bee infestation but also helped protect the bees themselves.\n\nFrom that day forward, Emily became known as the \"Bee Savior\" in her neighborhood. She continued to spread awareness about the importance of bees and their conservation. She even started a small garden in her backyard, filled with flowers that attracted bees and other pollinators.\n\nEmily's actions inspired her neighbors to take an interest in the environment and the creatures that inhabited it. Together, they formed a community group dedicated to promoting sustainable practices and protecting their local ecosystem.\n\nAnd so, thanks to the bravery and compassion of a little girl named Emily, both her neighbors' home and the bees found a safe and harmonious solution. Emily's story became a reminder that even the smallest acts of kindness and knowledge can make a significant impact on the world around us."]}, {"instruction": "Which is a species of fish?
